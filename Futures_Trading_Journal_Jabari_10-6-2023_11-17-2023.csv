/MCL,10/6/23,7:30 AM,"Price has fallen from $90 through $87 and $84, so there and has currently found support around $82. We would see a further drop off this morning to $79 or further towards $74. Or we could see a recovery to $84, $87. As of right now it feels like downwards pressure towards the 70s ",N/A
/MES,10/9/23,7:14 AM,"Demand/Support @4260, price at 4320, Supply/Resistance at 4380. Daily chart is currently bearish and price feels like it's going up, based on a bounce off 4242 on 10/6. That said, price reached a high of 4358 and reject it. If price reverses, we could see a pull back into 4240. On 15m chart, price just went through a breakout from 4310 to 4317 after reaching a low of 4299 at 2am this morning. Price is currently trading in a narrow range at 4315-4322, waiting for a breakout. 5m chart tells the same story as 15m chart. Price is trading slowly right now with ambivalence ",Y
/MCL,10/9/23,7:19 AM,"Price gapped up from $82 to $86 on the daily chart between 10/6 - 10/9 while the market was closed! This was unexpected! Could see a gap down today. Price reached a high of $87, which is the next supply/resistance zone and backed away from it a bit. On 1hr, price gapped from a close of $82.78 to an open of $84.76, reaching a more reasonable/maintained high of $86.40, finding support at $84.86 so far. On 15m, price is trading sideways around $86, poised for a break out. We could see price return to $87 or close the gap back to $83. $87.50 and $88 are the next supply zones. On 5m chart, watch for a move back down to $85.50. or a move back up o $87.10. Current price at $86.16. Price moving slowly & ambivalently while the market decides which direction to break out in",Y
/MCL,10/9/23,8:48 AM,"Today's trading day went really well! I ordered groceries, including berries, so my nutrition is back to being healthy & energetic! I lost once, and kept my risk to at most $10, but really I was right about the direction just too impatient so I ended up stopping out at a $4 loss and then the trade went the direction i had hoped. I re-entered and made up for the loss. I only traded 4 times today (knowing my max is 10 trades) and my goal was to reach at least $50 profit. I reached a daily profit of $55 so a net profit of $35 after fees. What I really liked about today is that I flowed with the market AFTER making solid plans. Then, I breathed a little easier, allowing 0.20 price moves instead of 0.10 price moves, making my trades more efficient. Finally, after reaching my daily goal I STOPPED TRADING FOR THE DAY. (This is back to the wisdom of ""KNOW WHEN TO STOP"".). In truth, I wanted to stay in and reach $100 profit for the day. That said, I know that I'm just starting to rebuild my trading muscles just like my leg muscles for running. There's no point in overdoing it at the beginning. And yet, because I want to keep improving, I will now spend another two hours trading in the simulator. I'm also very happy that today felt more like a fishing day, where I let the trades come to me, deliberately waiting for breakouts at market open, knowing that price was trading in a balanced range",Y
/MES,10/10/23,7:30 AM,"Current price $4372. There's a bullish pattern on the daily chart. Price has support at 4235. Price is trading right around resistance/supply right now of 4365 so there's a question of whether price will break through bullishly trading up to $4443 or if price will fall back towards $4235. We could see $4480 over the next few days if price keeps climbing. Daily candles have a range of ~45-70 points so it's possible to reach $4443 today or to slide back to close to $4300. Waiting for volume/confluence from the market to know direction. 1hr chart shows price has been trading in a very narrow range ($4362 - $4380) since yesterday at 1pm so today might not be a breakout day. Strong support at $4365 since yesterday. 15m and 5m charts show the same. Right now a small trade from $4365-4375 is possible, but it will be more effective to wait for the breakout at market open. Observe that if I do this trade, it is a $50 profit trade, which will meet my goal for the day. RSI is pretty balanced at 47. Have to wait  ",N 
/MCL,10/10/23,7:49 AM,"Current price $85.99. Price has stayed in a tight range around $86 since yesterday's gap up. Because price reached a high of $87.23 yesterday and couldn't go further, I imagine price will close the gap back down to $82.  RSI is pretty balanced at 47 so have to wait. Yesterday's price movement was 2.55 so there will probably be enough price movement to capture $50+, which requires about a 1.00 price movement (2x 0.50 for safety). Support at $85.3. Resistance at $86.70 on 1hr chart. Lots of volatility. 5m chart shows a sell of from 86.30 to 86. So can probably ride the wave back up from $86.70 to $86.30, depending on whether the market decides to keep rebounding or push price lower",N 
/MCL,10/10/23,9:07 AM,"Not feeling too well because of dating life and lack of romantic interest from women. I knew this walking into the day and felt like I could trade through the pain. I started the day with a nice $16 win. Then I had a small $6 loss. Then I had a good $19 win. Then I proceeded to lose all of my profits for the day because of an execution mistake. I bought at 85.94 thinking price would range trade to 86.20. Then the nightmare began. I accidentally bought (again) at 85.80 thinking I had sold to stop out. Also I had set a limit order than I think went through as well, which ended up not being a good idea. So I had to stop out twice for essentially double the loss I had expected. Then, I decided to emotionally re-enter to make up for my losses (bad) and I was drained for the day and knew it. Fortunately I closed the trade at break-even, ending the day with $1 profit before fees lol instead of $50. I thought it was a good idea to go against the current of the trade for some reason and the market said it wanted to push price lower. Also, I did 6 trades today for $30 in fees, which felt like a good place to stop. If I had scaled up to 10 contracts, I would have only earned $10 today, down from $290. So lessons learned: Don't set & forget limit orders if I'm actively trading. Either fully set limit orders with one cancels the other or just trade manually. It's much harder to trade when I'm not feeling good emotionally. So all in all today was a good trading day for learning more about myself. Also, I didn't feel the limit order correctly. Price fell right through it instead of a bounce happening so those are things to be prepared about. Think about reward/risk of 2:1. So if I earn at least 0.20 on each trade I win and lose at most 0.10 on each trade I lose, then after 10 trades, assuming a 50% win rate, I will be up $50. Focus on this. The problem today was really in accidentally scaling up, which I'll now in the simulator just to see how it feels. I was at a $10 ($14) loss and was about to stop out. That's when my limit order kicked in and I didn't know what was happening with my positions. I thought I had closed my position only to find I was still in the trade because of the limit order and it was a losing position. Otherwise, I probably would have been at 5 trades and $15 profit",N 
/MCL,10/11/23,7:01 AM,"Feeling good, happy, and focused today! Current price is $85.39. On the daily chart, price has been trading flat since the gap up on 10/9 with slightly bearish movement overall, hinting at a gap close. On the 1hr chart, price tested a low of $85 at 6am, entering into $84, hinting at price falling (even though price rejected $84. The 15m chart shows a sell off into $84 is imminent, with lower lows being reached. Same on the 5m chart. Price recovered from 84.96 and reached a high of 85.48 before falling off again. I entered short at 85.20 to ride through to 84. Volume is back!  Note RSI is low (35) ",Y
/MES,10/11/23,7:09 AM,"Current price is $4404.5. Volume is back and price is moving slowly still. MES is bullish overall over the past 4 days. Yet price isn't moving quickly. The 1hr chart shows bullish momentum from 4391.5 at 2am to 4405.25 at 7am. That's about 14 points, which would have been $70 per contract. Price is climbing higher towards 4415 heading back towards 4435 over the next few days. On the 15m chart, price is flat hovering around 4404.44. Price appears to be bearish yet the 7am candle closed neutrally with a highly bullish cross. And I'm so wrong, price just super fell through to 4394! MES may be hard to trade! No, it's weird than that. Price also climbed higher at the same time to 4415! It tested both really quickly at the same time somehow! Yet actual price is down to 4399.5 now. So weird. Huge volume! 3x normal! 5m chart shows the same weird price movement. There wouldn't have been a clear way to risk manage this except to wait. Price is back up to 4402. Perhaps 7:30 AM is when people start trading /MES? 4x regular volume now!",Y
/MCL ,10/11/23,7:21 AM,Nice $20 trade to start off the day. Price fell through to $84 as expected. Waiting for the next 0.20 set up/pattern ,Y
/MCL,10/11/23,8:45 AM,"Another super hard fought day. Victorious because of God! Reached my $50/day goal with a revenue of $51 in 6 trades, earning a profit of ~$20. Had I scaled up, the profit would have been $480. I'm back in the simulator. This day made me super nervous because of the volatility. Also, for all practical purposes, I feel like I lost on my final trade of the day. While the trade was technically profitable, my risk management was bad. I could have easily lost $20 ($200 scaled up) on that trade. Price was up and down. I bought at the wrong spot as the knife fell and price didn't go back up to $85.30 as I had expected. My entry was bad as well. I thought I was entering close to $85.00 and got $85.07 at market price (think more deeply about the risk of entering/exiting at market prices when there's huge volatility.). Price was truly hovering around the $84.90 so it is a miracle I was able to exit around $85.15. The amount of patience & pain & anxiety endured was incredible. This was also a super risk trade because while the 5m cycle was bullish, the daily and hourly cycles are bearish. Totally expecting price to see new lows and close the gap. So yeah, more to learn. What kept me in the trade was seeing higher highs & lower lows. It would have been nice to set a limit order for 85.17, but i'm not sure if price would have reached 85.17 if I had done so because order flow can be seen. NOTE: *My final trade of the day was incredibly risky and I need to improve risk management around these kinds of trades*. Just a few moments later and price fell to a new low.of $84.68. Imagine if I had stopped out at $84.68 from $85.07. That would have been a $49 loss and I would have ended the day with a loss of $4 instead of a victory of $51. Thank you God. AND I KNEW THAT IT'S A BEARISH DAY so risking bullish trades during bearish days is not wise. I need to learn more about how to handle bearish days & practice more in the simulator. Actually, I had a really good trade today! After a loss where I was stopped out around $85.40, price went back down to around $85. I was preparing to re-enter around $85.20 but I *felt* something was wrong. So price is around $85.12-85.15 and I don't enter. I just sat back and watch. I even said out loud, ""It's a trap."" Then price skyrocketed to $85.57! I re-entered around $85.37 (again, watch the market entries because I wanted $85.40+) and rode the trade short close to $85 after waiting for some time. Then price proceeded to fall through $85 and I was like, ""Oh if I had just stayed in it would have been an amazing trade and I would have already reached my daily goal!"" That said, I'm happy that I exited where I did because *I Traded My Plan!* My plan didn't account for price falling through $85, it accounted for a bounce off $85. Again, more to learn!  ",Y
/MCL,10/12/23,4:01 PM,"I didn't trade today because of the story I told myself - ""the market's only tradeable from 7am-10am and I'll be enjoying food with friends at Huw's breakfast club until 11am"". I was wrong and each day is different. Granted, I was sleepy after such a big breakfast lol (reminder: watch out for pre-diabetes. I was sleepy because I ate too much sugar in one sitting.). If I had traded, there were really nice sell offs on both /MCL and /MES even at 1hr timescales where I could have easily earned $100 today if not $200. It was really a 1 contract, $200 day. That said, lesson learned about being more flexible. Next time I'll check what's happening in the afternoon. If the market is still active and I'm feeling performant, I'll trade. Reminder to self: It's all a learning process - enjoy the journey! Also, the good thing about today is that I followed through on my plan! I said, ""Hey, it's only one day of trading. The entire point of this new lifestyle is being able to enjoy a day off when I want to."" Today has been a day off from trading/working that I've truly enjoyed! Oh yeah, /MCL (and /MES) are now trading in tight ranges and poised for another breakout. It feels like price may go lower on /MCL back towards $77-78 over the next few days. Or price will climb steadily and retest $86. KEEP GOING!",N/A
/MCL,10/13/23,7:33 AM,"Current price $86.48! On 1 day chart Price climbed back up steadily back the where the gap up/gap down happened! So this confirms the increasing demand for oil! We're back to where we were on Monday. Althought this time it's likely that price will continue to climb higher to $89. On 1hr a HUGE break out occurred starting at 1am! What a move that I missed while sleeping! 15m chart shows support around $86 followed by a further bullish breakout. At 7 AM there was a rejection of $86.15. 5m chart shows lows as low as $85.78 and a reversal at $86.23 at 5:25 AM. Today the 15m chart might be easier to trade because of the volatility shown on the 5m chart. Anyway, it's a nice bullish day so far!",N 
/MES,10/13/23,7:41 AM,"Current price $4381. We're seeing a further sell off from yesterday. On the 1hr chart, price is actually recovering from the the sell off that happened at 3am. Price went from 4391 to 4365 and bounced. Will see a return to 4385 and possibly a bullish move afterwards. 1hr chart shows momentum loss at 4378, followed by a small sell off to 4372 before receovering. AND I'm in the simulator lolol. Nice bullish breakout happening on the 5m chart. It's a bullish day!",N 
/MCL,10/13/23,7:50 AM,"Went long at 86.87. Looking to sell near the high of 87.23. Also expecting price to reach new highs after it retests 87.23. And of course price starts selling off right after I enter lol. I can hold longer on this one because I'm waiting for a longer price movement. I'm waiting about 20-25min to see the trade play out. So around 8:20 AM for an exit. If I hang on through 87.40, then I will reach my goal for the day. I just have to be careful about what happens around 87.20. There will probably be a price battle there ",N 
/MCL,10/13/23,8:20 AM,"Just lost $80 on being confident in a bullish move that quickly turned around. This is bad because it was bad risk management. That said, it wasn't clear at all that someone would step in at 8am with a 0.61 sell off. 0.80 is like 2 days of work to recover. If I want to end the day with a $50 profit, I now need $130 profits. I read the market incorrectly and didn't stop out when I had reached a $20-30 loss, which would have been fine. It was 5m that got me - just 5m. An immediate reversal of price after I entered and with incredible volume ",N 
/MCL,10/13/23,8:38 AM,Just lost another $27 on aiming for a 0.20 trade that almost went through. I can't read the market today. All of my profits from this week have been wiped out. I am now at a loss of $107 for the day and a YTD profit of $2. I am incredibly frustrated. This was supposed to be an easy bullish day ,N 
/MCL,10/13/23,9:18 AM,"Today has been a really good learning day about scale and price movement. Price can *fall* really fast. This is where trading 1 contract at a time is excellent. I didn't lose $950 today, I only lost $95 because the scale is small. Part of good risk management will be knowing when to scale up and when to scale down. AVOID PURCHASING NEAR LOCAL HIGHS. This totally got me again. Price really seemed like it was going to break out to a new high and then price fell so fast in 5m. So it's something like this: Uncertain trades, 1 contract. Certain trades: 10 contracts. Imagine if I rode a really certain trade today for 10 contracts and earned 0.20. Then I would be up $200 and would have easily reached my daily goal. So things are fine! Everything is fine!",N 
/MCL,10/13/23,9:26 AM,"I decided to trade a little more. I saw price break through 85.93 so I decided to enter long at 86.02 for a nice 0.10 trade, bring my daily loss back down to $85. I might do one more trade to hit my max of 10 trades per day and then call it.",N 
/MCL,10/13/23,9:39 AM,"I got absolutely crushed during my final trade for the day. I don't know what is happening, but price movements gapped. I entered at $86.31 for a nice 0.10 trade again and price reversed, but it reversed *quickly*. 0.15 gap down making it hard to stop out. This is where I need to start adding back in limit orders to improve my trading. My stop losses are starting to be bad. Ended the day with a loss of $120 and an overall account loss of $11. Bad trading day. Will keep going and recover next week. Learning with every trade that market behavior changes often. Again, it was another significant loss on a 5m candlestick of ~$35. Depending on the day, it can be safer to go short instead of going long because the sell offs happen faster and steeper ",N 
/MCL,10/16/23,7:25 AM,"Okay, I'm definitely missing something. Definitely. Price is back up to $88.10!??? So price did break through and somehow I lost money on 10/13/2023 during a sell off that occurred around 7:50 AM. I see. I did miss some things. I wasn't wrong about the overall direction of price. I got intentionally stopped out at a significant loss on the way up to a higher price. That's incredibly interesting because I didn't plan for that to happen! If I had held through the low from 86.87 to 85.38 and done a swing to 88.10, I would have profited $120 instead of losing $120. Although, it would have been a bad trade because it felt like price was pushing to new lows while I was trading on Friday. Today I'll wait for additional confirmation ",Y
/MCL,10/16/23,7:33 AM,"Current price $88.12. Price is trading in a balanced range again and poised for another break out. This time I will wait until I see momentum. If price breaks out bullishly, a move towards $89.50 could happen. Or, if price breaks out bearishly, it would be a move back towards $86.23 (1hr chart). On 15m chart, lots of volume at 7:15am and a new high of 88.34. Starting to see a bit of a sell off, but still bullish. On 5m chart also seeing bullish momentum into 88.30 at 7:15am. Waiting for clear price movement. RSI is hovering around 70",Y
/MES,10/16/23,7:42 AM,Current price $4375.75. The MES price hasn't changed much.,Y
/MCL,10/16/23,8:59 AM,"Nice trading day with $57 profit. I'm stopping at this profit amount because I reached my daily revenue goal of $50-100, which is an incredible come back from losing $120 on Friday. I totally want to keep trading to see if I can earn $100 today and come closer to recovering my Friday loss and then profiting more. That's an emotional feeling/ego thing, rather than focusing on planning & executing high-quality trades. What I'll actually do now is open the Ninja Trader simulator and continuing trading there with paper money.",Y
/MCL,10/17/23,8:07 AM,Current price 86.58. Price has fallen back down to support. Could see price return to ~$84. Or price will finally make it back up to $89. Daily chart seems bearish but more so trading sideways after Friday's bullish momentum. 1hr chart shows price trading in a very narrow range ($87.09 - $86.11) => ~$1. Another break out should occur. The 15m chart has range trading opportunities. 5m chart is super choppy. It may be wise to trade at 15m or higher today,N
/MES,10/17/23,8:18 AM,Current price $4374.25. Price again hasn't changed much. Price is still trading sideways after the 10/4-10/11 break out,N
/MCL,10/17/23,9:39 AM,"Today was a semi-bad trading day. I lost on all 6 of my trades today. It's surprising to lose so many trades in a row, but that's okay. What's much more interesting is the way in which I lost. I kept aiming for 0.20 profit trades. The market kept giving me 0.10-0.15 trades and I wasn't accepting them. So on many of these trades I could have closed for a profit. Instead, I hung on to each trade, waiting for my desired exit price. And on each trade price reversed and *I stopped out*. What's cool about today is that I respected my stop outs, which actually prevented further losses! So my risk management was good! My exits were bad. I also now have a more natural rhythm for trading & risk. I'm willing to lose up to ~$50 a day and I'm now going to start aiming for $100 a day in profit. 2:1 does seem to be the right path for account accumulation. My problem right now is that my account keeps going sideways because I'm not keeping what I earn. So it's either got to be $50/day revenue goal and $25/day max loss or it's got to be $100/day revenue goal and $50/day max loss. Another thing that got me today is that there was almost no volume. Also, I traded against the flow of the market again. The market said it wanted to do a bullish breakout. Being nervous about losing to a false breakout on Friday, I looked for areas to short. I was wrong about this. If I had just gone with the bullish flow of the market I would have profited. Although the irony is that as soon as I decided to stop trading for the day, price had a sizeable sell off lol. The market is totally like that. After it knows your plan it will do the opposite (sometimes) haha. Other times things go exactly according to plan! I'm also not focused on losses so much right now because I'm still trying things and observing how the market responds to what I try. Ending the day up $100 overall account value is somewhat the same to me as ending the day with -$12 overall account value. I know I can earn my way back to having my account be profitable. The harder part is being able to win consistently enough to keep the profit. That's what I'm working on. And it's coming along one step at a time. New improvement: Start locking in profits. If I have at least 0.10 in profit and I'm waiting on 0.20 in profit, lock in the 0.10 so that in the worst case I still profit. Now this will definitely create early exits sometimes. Overall it may help others & myself keep more profits",N
/MCL,10/17/23,10:02 AM,"It's actually super clear why I lost today and it's okay! I hesitated on the bullish breakout and missed the trade. Then I said to myself, ""Price went up so fast, it must come back down"" and started planning for a reversal that I could short. I kept trading this plan and the price action I expected didn't materialize. So I got the pattern wrong. The question is: ""How could I have gotten the pattern right?"". Around 9am I should have known because sell offs usually happen quickly, not with hesitation",N
/MCL,10/17/23,10:09 AM,I just practiced the profit lock-in in the ninja trader simulator and it's beautiful! ,N
/MCL,10/18/23,8:08 AM,"Current price 86.39. Price is still mostly trading sideways after Friday's bullish breakout. There's a hint of price returning to 83.50, but price could turn around and climb higher. On the 1hr chart, price reached a high of 88.30 at 5am and is now decreasing from 88 again! A significant sell off! Will the bearish trend continue today? On a 15m chart there was a sizeable sell off that started at 8am with volume. On the 5m chart starting to see some bullish momentum. Price will likely ride back up to 87 during the stand and perhaps fall off more . It feels like volume is low again",Y
/MCL,10/18/23,8:23 AM,Went for a bullish reversal from 86.70 to 87. I incorporated a sell stop order to my exit (profit lockin) and it works well! Price is moving slowly and I felt like I was going to be stopped out because price wouldn't get above 86.80. When price did get above 86.80 I set a sell stop order at 86.80 and it netted me 0.08 profit after the stop order became a market order! So that's pretty good because it prevented me from losing on a winning traded! #progress!,Y
/MCL,10/18/23,9:29 AM,"Today I pushed through my limit with a new daily revenue record of $62! It was super hard fought because I needed faith to hold through the mean reversion. At 86.50 I was done! I was down $20-30 on the trade feeling less than enthusiastic about having to re-enter to claim victory over my daily goal. In truth, it's *in my mind*. As soon as I reached $53 (my $50+ daily goal) and decided to stretch towards $100 by doing one more profitable trade, *that's when the market felt like it went against me*. In reality, for greater profit I had to hold through greater pain. Something really odd is happening. While it's been a much improved day, I've observed that I lost every single trade yesterday and won every single trade today. That feels statistically unlikely, but I believe I traded 7 times yesterday and 6 times today. Fees are adding up! I've spent $576.17 on fees so far so I've done around 100 trades! Remember, *this is okay because I'm learning*. Right now I need to keep my focus on how to keep my profits, increase my daily profit to $100/day (with one contract), and decrease my daily losses to at most $25/day. After I arrive at profitability, the fees will disappear with scale. I can also start trading on Ninja trader to reduce fees (this will be a good idea because Ninja Trader will be my environment where I scale up). When I reach 1000 trades (~3 months), I should have a clear idea of what kinds of trades/patterns/market days I do well (richly) on, what kinds of trades/patterns/market days I do poorly on. And it should be *easy* to keep improving. That's what the AI should help others & myself with. So it's not, ""What's the probability that this trade will be a profit or loss"" it's, ""What's the probability that *you'll* profit from this trade given market conditions, your trading strategy, your trading plan, how you execute, and what your personality is."" It should be really easy with enough data to say, ""This is who you are and this is how you trade. Here's where you're good. Here's where you're bad. If you focus on where you're good within the markets, you could increase your profits X% and decrease your losses Y%, helping you arrive at your trading goal Z. ",Y
/MCL,10/19/23,8:22 AM,"Current Price 86.53. Not much has changed since yesterday. I'm online what feels a bit late today from a discipline perspective. Regular market hours start within 10min. I'm a bit groggy today from my week of extended birthday celebrating. Price has been reaching slightly lower lows over the past few days - not necessarily lower highs. On 1hr chart, I haven't missed much. Price sold off from $87 to $85.43 between 2-4 am today. Price bounced and is now at a point of indecision. Will price go back up to $87? Or will price fall through support at $85.38? 15m chart shows a peak of $86.84 at 7:30 AM. Not that much volume again. Price bounced on $86.38. 5m chart shows much more indecision around $86.50. ",Y
/MCL,10/19/23,9:03 AM,"Had some nice trades so far. Still need to improve at risk management. I'm learning that mean inversion does work! It also requires holding through the pain. Today I achieved an improvement over FCEL, where I profited from price returning to the mean instead of losing. Aiming for another $60+ revenue day to stretch myself. Either way, I'll flow with the market",Y
/MES,10/19/23,9:05 AM,"Current price $4343! Price has changed a bit since yesterday! Much more price movement today! A price sell off happened yesterday on 1d chart. Price is oscillating around $4333 on 1hr chart, with bearish movement. On 15m chart, price is bearish coming back to $4333. On 5m chart the bounce is at $4334. Not a good place to enter a trade because price is so close to the oscillation point. Price could go back up to $4351 or back down to $4333.",Y
/MES,10/19/23,9:32 AM,"Price returned to $4333! I saw price falling through $4333 and went short. Price hit $4328 almost instantly and I ended up with $20+ profit! Thank you God and my angels! #333. Aiming for $60 revenue today to stretch/grow. Also, today is the first day that I've felt intuition on when *not* to trade a financial instrument. /MCL is moving at a crawl after the trades from earlier and price is in such a narrow range around the oscillation point that it creates a huge trading risk that tells me not to trade MCL right now. I'm starting to be more patient and to focus on where there are *clear* trading opportunities! All good blessings & learnings!",Y
/MES,10/19/23,10:27 AM,"/MES crushed me lol. I decided to go long again for a reversal even though I already knew the trend was bearish. I could have stopped out at a small profit or loss after seeing that price was not moving according to my plan. Instead, I stayed in to let the trade play out. Price triple topped near where I purchased (ended up being a local high) and sold off. I lost ~$50, bringing my daily revenue to -$10 instead of +$40. I'm new to MES so this is okay. Have to keep going! Yeah, the market got me. Price is back up to $4333 now. So I couldn't hold on through the pain of -$50 and they knew. Dang ",N
/MES,10/19/23,10:37 AM,"Yeah MES is rigged. I literally re-entered around $4333 for another sell off after price rebounded. Of course, price decides to climb higher after that back through 4335 and towards 4340. I just lost another $30 and there's no reason that should have happened without the market being rigged. So now the question is: How can I rig the market in the favor of others? I wasn't wrong about the overall direction of the price movements. It's literally that when I went long, the market wouldn't rise higher than where I purchased and ultimately stopped me out. Then when I went short at the resistance point, price climbed higher and stopped me out again. Also, *fees* are adding up!",N
/MES,10/19/23,11:22 AM,"After reflecting, the key question I have for myself about today is: ""Why didn't I stop out at a $10 or $15 loss after I knew the MES trade wasn't going as planned?"" If I had done so, I would have still had a net profit on my MES trades as well as the day. Also, the 10:37 AM trade was an emotional trade placed hoping I could make up for my loss. I didn't have confirmation. So it's not rigged rigged. It's just that I have to remember to wait for confirmation",N
/MCL,10/19/23,11:28 AM,How did I miss a truly bullish & easy day on MCL? Why is it that as soon as I changed over to MES that MCL went up effortlessly?,N
/MES,10/19/23,11:34 AM,In the MES simulator now. Got it! MES isn't rigged. What happened is that I'm not used to the sometimes fast price movement on MES. It can go from really slowly moving prices to really fast moving prices! Price just went from $4360 to $4316 within 10m after I waited 55m to get stopped out on my long trade. I need to pay attention to when trading activity is happening and accept that prices can move quickly after feeling like they're moving slowly! I need to spend more time practicing on MES. Also I feel good about how the day went now - knowing that I tried something new: Trading a new financial instrument (MES)! And I did so for a good reason: No trading opportunities on MCL at the time! So it's all a work in progress and things are moving in the right direction!,Y
/MES,10/19/23,11:42 AM,I just made $51.25 in a few minutes on MES within the Ninja Trader simulator. A $40 loss is nothing lol. NEED TO PRACTICE LEARNING HOW MES TRADES,Y
/MCL,10/19/23,12:48 PM,"Observe that MCL has a nice bullish run today. If I had been patient, I would have been able to profit $60 today instead of being down $42. Think about that. I probably could have even profited $100 today. So what really happened is that I shifted to a new financial instrument (MES) and didn't perform well because I'm not yet familiar with MES. Imagine trying to shift from playing guitar to drums at a gig. While I can perform reasonably well shifting from guitar to piano, I'm just less comfortable on drums. In the same way, I will become comfortable with MES in time ",N

A sell off is happening and I missed some nice trades earlier this morning. Price closed at 88.30 on Friday and opened at 88.00 today (Sunday). Overall, monthly, price is on an upward trend. So it's like we're seeing a pull-back before more bullish momentum. Price is retesting $87 and may fall through again!

That said, price also has support so far at $86.87. So I'll have to watch carefully for a bounce or a sell off. RSI is currently at 40 so MCL is oversold. 15min chart shows bullish movement, a bounce from 86.83. Yet there's been heavy volume on the bearish candles at 8am and 8:30am.

/MCL,10/23/23,9:43 AM,"I'm starting to see how instituitional buying works. I went short around 86.76 thinking that because price fell through the low, we'd see a steep sell off. What ended up happening was that buyers stepped in with huge volume and I had to stop out. Yet, the volume amount shows me that it's very clear where institutions or a large groups of buyers are buying ",Y

I believe I only had an unrealized loss of only a few dollars while waiting for the trade to unfold. Happy about the patience I put into waiting for the right entry and being intentional about my exit. This shows improvement.",Y
/MCL,10/23/23,10:57 AM,"I finally learned the value of setting stop losses the hard way. MCL came through with a nice sell off that I was able to capture part of. I decided to go long to ride the wave back up to 87 and what I learned is that PRICE CAN CHANGE QUICKLY. So I went from a really nice risk managed trade of losing $10-12 to losing $27 in an instant. I stopped out, but this rapid price movement wiped out my profits for the day. If I'd had a stop order in place, I would have maintained good risk management and kept my profits",N
/MCL,10/23/23,11:15 AM,Reflection: I know price has a downward trend so I could have factored that into trading today and kept going short instead of going long,Y
/MCL,10/23/23,11:42 AM,"I ended the day with 10 trades an only $4 gross profit. Almost all of my profits from Friday were wiped out because of fees (fees are still a thing). The good news is that my overall account after fees is STILL PROFITABLE. So again, it's a learning process. Today was actually pretty awesome considering I didn't sleep well. I'm starting to notice a pattern of being up towards my goal and doing well and then messing up just before I reach my goal. I need to fix this. Also, I need to increase my goal to $100/day per contract. Today's lessons include making sure to always set my stop loss and exits in advance. Or at bare minimum, always set my stop losses. Then I can adjust my exits and do profit lockins if it makes sense. Today was a good profit lockin day! Also nice use of setting exit orders! Also, I learned that if price is outside of the range of the chart then I have to set entries/stop-losses/exits manually in the Order Ticket. Overall it was a good day because my account is still profitable despite a significant unexpected loss. Also I learned that a trade can go from a reasonable unrealized loss of ~$10 to ~$30 quickly! AGAIN, SET MY STOP LOSSES IN ADVANCE, ESPECIALLY ON BREAK OUTS. Another good thing was seeing that there truly is such a thing as a good entry. When I make good entries I tend to see price pull back to an unrealized loss of 0.01-0.05 only to have price come back around and the trade to execute profitably. The market requires patience. I ran out of patience on my final trade for the day and exited with $4 gross profit instead of $16 gross profit. Of course, after I exited, price fell through to $86 (and even lower!). I could have easily gotten $30 gross profit and made up for my fees, but my mind got tired. Also, I made $76 today in gross profit, despite losing about the same amount! So I need to increase my winners and decrease my losers with more effective risk management. I lost $72 today. And my win rate was 60% so I'm still winning about twice as often as I lose which is good! Have to keep going! ",N
/MCL,10/23/23,1:23 PM,"Reflection: The trade I lost ~$30 on today was a good trade. While I was aware of the downward trend of MCL, I also saw price bounce off the low for the day and that we were in a pull back before reaching new lows. What I thought would be true is that the same pullback would occur after price reached a new low. Yeah! And it's hard because this happened on my first trade! Price went to a new low so I went short and then had to cover at a loss. Price *bounced* when I thought it wouldn't. So the next time around, I thought price would bounce again, *and it didn't*. Better risk management would have prevented the ~$30 loss and kept it at $10-$15 (although it should have been a $5-10 loss at most). The thing I need to figure out is *What is happening?* *How can I know with increased accuracy whether price will bounce or break through?* Because price reached a balanced level where I felt a bounce would occur, and I tried the bounce multiple times! If I had thought about it like Carmine said to do, then I would have leaned towards the sell off continuing to occur where I had this loss because the low had been retested multiple times (i.e. there wouldn't have been as many orders at that price to do another bounce). Keep going!",Y
Monthly Reflection,10/23/23,8:11 PM,"Reflection: Feeling off track in terms of my trading goals, but I'm actually reasonably on track. The ToS fees have drained my account, eliminating net profit while my gross profit is actually positive (although just barely lol). In Ninja Trader, I've only traded two days so far and my account is still at a net profit *after* fees and an unexpected loss. Something to note is that if I had stopped trading when I was up $43 for the day with $33 net profit, I would be reasonably on track for ending the week at $200+ minimum gross profit and possibly net profit. So I have to keep focusing on reaching my goals and being okay with some losses along the way as I learn. Remember! It's a learning process!",Y
/MCL,10/24/23,8:22 AM,"Price is trending upward overall on the daily chart, with a pull back towards $84.00. Current price is $85.06. Still learning. I entered into a short trade as I saw price falling through. I automated my orders and got stopped out. Then the trade went through as I had planned so I had to re-enter at a lower price. Then my exit order got filled so I only got some of the profit. Then I re-entered and got stopped out. Currently at at -$9 gross loss, with -$17.16 net loss. Feeling *very* frustrated. Setting automated stops is stopping me out too often again ",N/A

/MCL,10/24/23,9:08 AM,"My mood is starting to improve after eating veggies. I can only trade well when I'm in a good mood. I earned $10 gross profit which is clearing up some of my losses. What I've learned is that setting automated stops & exits isn't effective during standard market open when price is volatile. So I have to ask myself if I'm doing a volatility play or if it's a trend trade. Today I tried to do a trend trade while a volatility play was happening. Observe carefully what happened on this last trade: I was down almost $20 in unrealized loss and super frustrated because my entry was around a price level that kept recurring and it's a bearish day. When I enacted *patience*, price came back around and allowed me to profit. My exits were too far away from price during volatility so I ended up losing (again) on what otherwise would have been profitable trades had I exited while I was up during the volatility. Every day is different. My mood isn't always good. I have to keep going! When I return in an hour after resting some more & praying, I'll find some high quality trades. I'll give myself the grace of starting the trading day over with a clear mind. Remember, I'm now at a daily *net* loss of -$44.32. This is about 2% of my total account value. *Everything is fine* and I have to get back to consistent profits",N

This time I will be more patient! Observe that my plan was good and that my execution earlier today was bad. If I had just held to 84, I could have set my stop at 85.50 and walked away with $100 profit today (in 1 trade, instead of losing $44.32 on 8 trades). ",N

/MCL,10/24/23,11:48 PM,"Overall a bad trading day. Starting over was good. I'm starting to see patterns where I need to improve. I had some quality trades after restarting. I got my account back to a gross loss of $1.25 and felt like I could bring my account back to a net profit with just a few more quality trades (which is true). Whenever I get into this mindset, then I stop focusing on what price is doing and start focusing on trying to be right. I lost $30 on a trade because of poor risk management because I wanted to be right about pricing selling from VWAP-ish back to $83. Price reversed and I didn't stop out. I'm still learning how to do this. When I add automated stops, I get stopped out right before my trade goes through as planned. When I don't stop out, price reverses and I lose $30. So I'm doing something wrong. So much of this feels like golf where I'm off just by a little bit on hitting the ball far. I overtraded today with 16 trades. Again, I have to watch my mood and what I consume before trading. Also, I need to start thinking in terms of wider price moves. Today if I had purchased at $83, I could have waited 30min to make $70+. So there is something to be said about being too granular. Also! This time when I entered a bullish trade after getting stopped out on a short trade, price kept going up for a bit! So there's something there as well!",N 
/MCL,10/24/23,12:08 PM,"I decided to try one more trade with an automated stop loss and exit. My stop loss got triggered, which leads me to believe that some weirdness is happening in the market. Need to think creatively about how to solve this. So my account is down $91.63 now. I have to remember that the market knows where the orders are and be very careful. All in all, my account is down around 5%, which is okay. It's twice as much as 2% risk, but it's not so bad. I can earn back my net loss in 2 days as long as I reach my goals. The trick is that there are weird things happening in the market + my bad execution that lead to losses today (mostly my bad execution). Although it's super weird how often price reverses after I enter, regardless of the trend direction. Also, my gross loss today is $57.25, which is around 3%, so remember that my account is okay and life is good! I live to trade another day!

/MCL,10/24/23,12:55 PM,"I finally got a good trade in the simulator based on following the trend! Something weird happened with how I set my automated orders, but the core idea was there. I earned $124 in gross profit, and there's more to learn! I entered 10 contracts long around $83.87 and trusted the trend, placing my exit at $84. *The trade was 20min long*, not 2min, not 5min, *A Full 20min*. While these trades can happen faster, the point is that this quality trade (not random) required time to marinate. Also, *price increased* as soon as I got up from my computer and stopped trying to control things! So way more to learn, and I can start reducing risk around scaling by trading on the 15min scale with clear entries, exits, and stop losses rather than focusing on 0.10-0.20 scalps. They can still be scalps, just that they're materializing from clear price direction rather than volatility. Glad I tried scaling up in the simulator! It's easy to lose a lot of money quickly so that's something I'll have to really risk manage. Also, the market does what it wants lol. Also, scaling up comes with market effects! It's not a bulk order of 10 contracts all the time. Sometimes the order is split into smaller orders of 1 contracts, 3 contracts, etc. and that creates confusion around closing the contracts. Like when my limit order was reached, that's why multiple orders went through and there were still 3 positions open that I had to manually close. So I'll need to adapt to this",Y

Also, timing again. As soon as I lost $20 on price selling off (even though I was saved from the large sell off), price is back up and I would have had a profitable trade.

I've been setting my stops to at most 0.15 (aiming for 0.10) and intending to exit at 0.20 profit! If ATR is 0.40, up from 0.25, then even a 0.15 stop is likely to be triggered! So!

I entered in the simulator at $84.35 and price went up to a high of $84.88, hitting resistance 3x! This was easily a $50 profit trade! Which is a reminder that the high-quality trades are there when I focus on patience, trends, and supply & demand. The trades are not there (low-quality) when I become undisciplined and make volatility plays. Now, know that this trade went from a winning trade to a losing trade so that reminds me to add a trailing stop! But rememember, if the trailing stop doesn't account for volatility I'll get profit locked into the trade too early. Remember that this is what happened to me on AAPL back in 2017. KEEP GOING! Imagine $200 a day in net profit from 1 contract! Today could have easily been a $500 day if I scaled up and had managed the trade from a profit lockin standpoint. Oh!

Today is a really good supply & demand day. There's strong demand between $82-82.50 and strong demand at $86. 15m chart shows nice bullish movement through the demand zone I drew. Same with 5m chart. If price breaks through the zone with momentum, I'll go long towards $85 again.   ",Y
/MCL,10/26/23,10:11 AM,"I placed a nice, quality bullish supply & demand trade and got stopped out. Price couldn't get the gas when I entered to keep climbing higher towards $85. What I liked about this trade is that I set my stop loss at just a bit more than ATR, which did prevent getting stopped out due to volatility. So when I got stopped out, I knew price wasn't heading in the direction of my plan at that time. Price fell to $83.65, which feels way more comforting than price reversing as soon as I got stopped out. ATR has merit to it for setting stop losses! ",Y
/MES,10/26/23,10:13 AM,Price did eventually reach $4200 and is now at $4180! ,Y
Account issue,10/26/23,10:14 AM,This morning Ninja Trader placed a liquidation-only restriction on my live trading account due to missing documents or something. This may be a blessing. I am leveraging the time while waiting to sort through my account to trade within the simulator ,Y
Improvement area,10/26/23,10:19 AM,Something I would like to improve on is being able to juggle multiple positions well. I missed the MES move to $4200 (although there was a gap down that caused this) ,Y
Platform Change,10/26/23,10:26 AM,"Ninja Trader is having website issues that are preventing me from trading in the simulator now. I wonder if Ninja Trader is stable/reliable? Imagine if I had an open trade right now that I was losing on and couldn't access the web trading platform to stop my loss? Also, Ninja Trader seems to have removed my access entirely while my account is being reviewed? Or the site is down? There's a risk here! Of course, if I wanted to I can still trade on ThinkOrSwim or Interactive Brokers. and Yet there's a risk! I will have to wait (and maybe go on a break). Interactive brokers has higher margins than ToS and higher fees (although I can practice)",N/A
/MCL,10/26/23,12:10 PM,"I finally got a good trade in the simulator! My larger supply & demand plan didn't work so I had to adjust to a smaller range-trading supply & demand trade and earned $33 profit from this trade! What I liked about it was experiencing the ups & downs of a high-quality trade. Price went up to $83.99 ($0.06 lower than my exit!) and fell back down and yet my stop wasn't reached this time. Price hovered around my entry and eventually came back up and hit my exit! *Seeing it helps*! Because, just as I've been telling myself that the market is not a straight line up & to the right, *experiencing it* feels different. It's much more like a probability space with many oscillations. I believe the key is knowing the oscillations that are happening on each time scale and the indications that they'll repeat!",Y
/MES,10/26/23,12:33 PM,"Got it! Made a nice $37.50 profit on a high quality trade, based on the trend! The ATR really works so far because it adjusts my trading to be closer in alignment with reality. Instead of being frustrated at getting stopped out because emotionally I can't handle say a $20 unrealized loss, I'm now finding a $20 unrealized loss to be comfortable *because it's within ATR*. So instead of setting my stop losses emotionally, I'm now setting them to flow with the expectation of volatility. If it had been up to my emotions, especially not knowing MES so well yet, I would have set my stop loss at $4163 to only have a $10 loss. Instead, I set a nice stop loss at $4170 that was never reached and waited *patiently* for price to fall through $4150. I ended up not being fully patient haha because I have other things I want to do today so I closed early for a profit. The trading day ended well with $3.76 net profit! Even though it's the simulator it still counts! ",Y
Daily Reflection,10/26/23,12:42 PM,"I did 6 trades today in the simulator and made a *tiny* net profit! This is much better than my recent days and I'm starting to see the bigger picture of trends now! Trading requires *so much patience*. Even when trading plans are good and trades are high quality, it takes time for price movement to unfold! ",Y
/MCL,10/27/23,9:15 AM,"Today I'm trading in the simulator to get my groove/edge back! In many ways, I'm ending the month down ~$100 instead of up $1000. This is bad. At the same time, yesterday's Ninja Trader meeting taught me that the process of becoming a good trader requires 9-12 months, not 1 month. So I'm dealing with the reality and continuing to improve! On the Daily chart, price is at $83.80 and trading within a consolidation range of $82 - $85.50. On the 1hr chart, price reached a high of $85.36 at 4am and again at 5am – solid resistance. Price also has support at $83. On the 15m chart, price is having difficulty breaking through $84.10. I may have entered a trade too early. 5m chart shows heavy resistance right at where I bought at $84.05. We'll see how this trade turns out. I set my exit at a $50 profit and my stop at a $20 loss. ATR is at 0.60 today! So the chances of getting stopped are high... and I just got stopped out lol. ",N 
/MES,10/27/23,9:38 AM,"On the daily chart, price is consolidating around $4160 again. Price bounced off $4150 yesterday instead of reaching $4135. The overall trend is still bearish, yet price may pull back and climb higher before falling through 4150 to 4135 and 4100. On the 1hr chart there's resistance at $4185 and support at $4150. Price may fall through $4150 next time it's retested. 15m chart shows a daily downtrend. I want to go long because there's bullish movement happening on 15m and 5m, but the top of the current candle hit the low of the 6:45 am candle at 4161 and reversed from it. So going long seems like not a good idea. At least not unless price breaks above 4164 ",Y
MCL,10/27/23,9:53 AM,"MCL totally got me just like Adam Fiske said! Anticipation! Price stopped me out at 83.80, went to a low of 83.35 and is now back up to 83.67. The truth is that ATR is pretty high today, even on 5m. I set my stop at 0.20 loss while ATR is at 0.32. So that says ",N
/MES,10/27/23,10:34 AM,"Re-entering a trade after a profit lock-in is similar to a scale in! (But it's not because the contract size is the same). Also, remember that Adam Fiske said trading 1 contract won't give someone an edge! Need to trade multiple contract sizes",Y
/MES,10/27/23,10:37 AM,The dopamine thing is true! Adam is right! I re-entered after a winning trade (because of dopamine) and now I'm losing on this trade more than I profited!,Y
Daily Reflection,10/27/23,11:18 AM,"I need to trade in the simulator until I get back to consistent wins! (Hopefully next week!). My total profit today was $52.25, with a solid $11 profit lock-in on MCL (where I lost *consistently* today) and two really quality $20+ profit trades on MES! My final trade on MES was low quality in terms of entry and good in terms of risk management. So I didn't stop out on this one and ended up with an unrealized loss of $30 which scared me. That said, I know MES is currently bearish and on the 5m chart I was able to see that the $30 unrealized loss was from a reversal of the sigifnicant sell off and that it had lost momentum. So I held onto the trade. Then the market messed with me multiple times lol. I set my stop at exactly $20 profit and it feels like the market doesn't like when my $20 profit trades go through haha. The market will give me $60+ at random, but when I set my exit it says no haha. So I set my stop at 4158 and the market kept bouncing at 4158.50 and also 4162, where I opened my position haha. Finally the market came through and reached my exit! Thank God! On the MCL side I lost consistently on nearly all of my trades. 5 trades in a row reversed on me! And when I checked candle sticks afterwards I saw that price direction was not clear. Just had a mistake on MES where I forgot to cancel an order entry! I have to remember to do this! And now I'm in a losing trade and I couldn't remember whether it was a short trade or a long trade (it was my original exit (buy to close)). It bought to open since I didn't have an open position lol. Anyway, great learning day! God helped me on that accidental trade and I exited around break-even afer fees!",Y
/MCL,10/30/23,8:57 AM,"I'm trading in the simulator to take trading seriously. Because the Ninja Trader simulator appears to behave exactly like the live market, it's a wonderful practice environment while I'm learning. Today I'm returning to catalysts because I can seee now they are important. MCL is currently priced at $84.11 and is trading in a consolidated range (STILL) roughly between $84-$85, which has been true since 10/25. So MCL isn't in play right now, or it could be said that MCL is range trading, rather than trend trading. This is probably what contributed most to ending the previous week with a loss. On 1hr chart there's not much MCL activity today. There was a sell off from $84.80 to $83.65 that happened from 5am to 8am and now price is bouncing. It's enough to capture ~$100 for the day so it's enough to capture $50 for the day, but here's the problem: 1hr ATR is at 0.57 so even if I were able to capture $100 or even $50, my stop loss would need to be at 0.60 to account for volatility, which says that I would need to have a clear trend with at least 1.20 in price movement to make the trade worthwhile. Otherwise I'll just get stopped out. 15m chart shows choppiness starting at 8am: A bullish candle with a high of 84.28 & a low of 83.65 and followed by a bearish candle with a high of 84.37 & 83.78. 5m chart shows price bouncing at support around 83.70 and I just felt *anticipation*! Yeah, like Adam said, I want to go long now that price is bouncing, even though I just wrote that MCL is in play. It's the 5m 0.212 ATR that is captivating me. It's got me thinking I can risk ~$20 for $40+ without verifying what the market is doing. ",Y
/MES,10/30/23,9:18 AM,"MES is very much in play with a clear bearish trend on the daily chart. Why is it in play? What news is causing people to sell? Current price is $4163. Price just keeps breaking to lower lows & lower highs. It's actually pretty interesting that I've lost money while live trading MES because the trend is so strong. There are bullish rallies happening while the rips are happening, but this is an instrument where if I had just short sold on 10/12 from $4400, I would have ~240 * $5 = $1200 in profit right now! Of course, this requires swing trading instead of intraday trading. Still, if I had just done that and pruchased 10 contracts, I would have ended this month with $12k in profit! KEEP GOING! 1hr chart shows really interesting price movement, with price hitting a new low of $4122 on 10/27 at 2pm and price sort of recovering from that and now bouncing. Price reached a high of $4184 today during 8am-9am and has since sold off back to $4160. On 15m chart there's heavy volume (~60,000 contracts exchanged so far). On 5m chart price is trying to push back up and bounce off demand. Can it? Observe that this is where I feel the most joy in trading. There are a bunch of people trading and we're all trading democratically and trying to figure out what direction we want to push price in. There are buyers & sellers and we're trying to see who will win. It feels less about trying to target and exploit specific traders based on vulnerabilities. Keep it fun! This is why people trade the large futures indexes. A good plan is to add in the MYM and MNQ and also MNG (because natural gas is cool! and I need it to heat my home/cook my food haha))",Y
/MES,10/30/23,9:34 AM,"I'm aiming for a bullish move back towards 4175 today because price is oversold at 4160 and 4184 is the top of the range.I may have entered too early. Also, I accidentally opened a position with 2 contracts instead of 1 lol. I entered at 4160, set my stop at 4155, which aligns with 5m ATR, and I set my exit at 4175.25. So if all goes well, I'll end up with revenue of ~15 * 5 = 75 * 2 = $150. And if I get stopped out, then it's a loss of ~5 * 5 = 25 * 2 = $50 (very reasonable trade!). Just have to wait now. Remember, RSI is at ~25 so the instrument is oversold. That said, we'll see what price does ",Y
/MES,10/30/23,9:54 AM,"I have to start thinking more like a trader. It's true that other traders are reading what other traders are doing. I set a reasonable stop where I would have lost ~$50. Price hit my stop! And then, like Adam Fiske said, price climbed up right after it hit my stop. I was fortunate in that I saw the bullish momentum and re-entered at 4160. Then I siked myself and exited for $52.50, which was exactly what I had lost, bringing my gross P&L to $0 lol. The good news is that my roundtrip fee on trading *2* contracts was only ~$3.50! ",Y
Daily Reflection,10/30/23,10:58 AM,"TODAY WAS REALLY GOOD! Of course, there are still *many* improvements that I need to make! I like that I traded seriously in the simulator. It also turns out that the Ninja Trader simulator is a great place for me to be now while I'm learning. In truth, while I was bummed about the $100 I lost ($45 in trades, ~$60 in fees), it turns out that had I earned $1000 in profit this month (profit, not revenue), it still wouldn't be enough ***yet*** to cover my expenses in a meaningful way. Covering expenses and beyond is really going to come from scaling, which has to come from knowing myself & knowing what to expect from the market. What I loved about today is that I tried some new things. I tried scaling to 2 contracts per trade instead of 1 contract per trade. This actually didn't go as well as I expected because my earnings didn't scale with the number of contracts (which is surprising). I earned a profit of $41 today and a net profit (after fees) of $23.60. AND I DECIDED TO STOP THERE because of what Adam Fiske said about the dopamine hit thing. I'm here to learn & win & be succesful & help other people become successful at multiplying their money. I'm not here in the market for dopamine hits. That said, this is back to what the Apostle Paul wrote about in Romans: The Spirit has good intentions. The body is filled with Sin. So the Sin in me is here for dopamine hits and that's a reality I have to deal with. What was really cool about today was starting to learn about how liquidity works, based on what Adam Fiske shared. What he shared is true! The market found my stop orders on my initial trade and it stopped me out for a loss of ~$50, which I was happy to accept based on my trading plan. What I didn't like was that I felt exploited because price went back up as soon as my stops were triggered. So it told me that other traders were searching for that kind of play. Anyway, I re-entered for a nice bullish trade (my original trade) and got my money back with a ~$50 profit! Then I felt like I knew what was going on so I started playing based on the rules of the game. I re-entered MES at a high, where I shouldn't have, based on bullish volume. Price sold off from there and I didn't stop out because I had seen the ranges of the day and had a strong feeling price would return to where my trade was profitable (and not much beyond that). So I waited ***patiently*** and was able to exit this trade for a tiny profit of say $5 (so a net profit of $1.50). Also, *I started exploring other futures instruments that have **large volume***. What I'm starting to learn is that I enjoy social trading! I like when there are many people trading and how we can trade democratically. So I had success on trading the MYM (micro e-mini Dow Jones futures) today based on trends! This is an interesting instrument because it seems to have a multiple of 0.50 per 1.00 price movement and yet price moves a lot. I also added the MNQ (micro nasdaq 100 futures) and NG (natural gas futures) to my portfolio/watch list. I was awe struck to find that the MES is really just the MNQ! It tells me that Big Tech is really driving the US economy (currently), which is reassuring because I'm an experienced & competitive software engineer. I just need to keep focusing on serving God and helping others with my gifts. Natural gas is pretty interesting because prices have actually fallen off 50% this year! Commodities such as MCL and NG have less trading volume and are harder to tell whether or not they're in play. Like MCL wasn't in play this morning when I created my trading plan. Then, while I was off in MES land, MCL became in play somehow and I wasn't sure why. All of a sudden there was a clear bearish trend for the day. This is bad because it was actually very easy for me to see the trends today on MES and MYM and trade both at the same time. Whereas MCL I was like, ""What changed within the few minutes after I made my plan???"" Anyway, amazing trading day in terms of growth! Adam Fiske is right about hiding P&L and focusing on trade quality because I ended up anchoring to my daily goal of $50 instead of letting my winners run. All good lessons to learn. I'm super excited to keep learning & growing, and loving the process. I love what Kobe Bryant & Kevin Hart said: ""It's not really the results that ultimately matter; It's the person you grow into along the way who's able to achieve the results that matters."" So I'm happy to be growing into the person I want to become! And I'm happy when others join me on the journey, like Yang and Chuchu!   ",Y

Price is now back up at 83.12 with ""VWAP"" (triangle average price) being around 82.80. On the 15m chart, the dip into the high 81's ended up being a good entry.

On the 15m chart, price is starting to come back down to 4170 with slightly bearish price movement after reaching a high of 4199.

/MCL,10/31/23,9:50 AM,Nice $15 profit on what I would have wanted to be at least a $20 profit trade. *Patience is key*. Especially with the volatility on MCL. I covered early because price bounced off support at 82.80 instead of falling through. And it was a good idea because the market did a fake after I covered to get more liquidity. Price dipped down to high 82.60s/low 82.70s making it seem like a further sell off would occur only to bounce back up to what is now 82.90. Sometimes it's good to know when to cover a trade and accept that the original plan didn't work ,Y

Daily Reflection,10/31/23,11:21 AM,"Today I'm up $221 gross profit, and $205 net profit in the simulator! I have an unrealized loss of ~$90 on MES that will soon clear. It's my heart. I have a reason now to fight: to make sure beautiful people have the resources they need to keep sharing their light so that more of us feel loved, respected, appreciated, and more. I finally understand that our personal *why* is the *Cookie Jar* David Goggins speaks about. Our *why* isn't about joy & happiness per say. It's about the pain we're willing to endure to get there. It's being on mile 60 of an ultra marathon feeling like your body is about to collapse and wondering *why* you even signed up. I love this world. I love the beauty we had when I was growing up - when people were united & kind to each other. It wasn't perfect... and I was also mistreated by people from time to time. Yet I was surrounded by so many good people who I would have loved to be role models for my future kids. And it's disappearing. With every attack someone beautiful & creative faces, their light dims. And I'll willingly sacrifice myself if I have to in order to keep the light bright. Today I tapped into full leverage on natural gas futures and I see now how life-changing it is! (Of course, with every significant profit there's a chance of a significant loss so I have to be careful). Yet, now I see it! I'm also starting to see the cycles more clearly and have more patience, which is super important for The Fin Tea and risk management. The question is: ""How long can you wait?"" With FCEL I found that waiting 5 years feels like too much even though I decided to hold. With trading futures I've been very impatient and have gotten into a bad habit of ""Oh the trade has to go through within the next 10min or I have to stop out."" Now I'm starting to see that if I pay attention to the bigger, overall picture, it's okay to endure some urealized losses on the way to profits. I don't know why I didn't close my automated MES orders. And while price is going up in the short-term, within a day it's likely that my orders to cover my position will go through at a small profit because the overall trend is bearish ",N 
/MCL,11/1/23,8:38 AM,"Hard to know price direction. Also, something is wrong with my orders. I found myself accidentally in a trade again. I closed for a profit of $77 which is awesome, but I'm pretty sure I closed all of my MCL orders yesterday so this is bad. Anyway, MCL is up today and hovering around 82.90. Significant bullish price movement from 81.04 @ 12am to 83.42 @ 8am. What's cool is seeing the cycles! I actually probably just didn't remember this trade from yesterday lol. I purchased yesterday at 11am! And price went down a ton! And today I closed for a nice profit at 82.88! So there are swing trading opportunities! BUT, THIS WAS A BAD TRADE BECAUSE IT WAS A DAY TRADE TURNED INTO A SWING TRADE INSTEAD OF ORIGINALLY BEING A SWING TRADE. Anyway, my mind is oppening up to the numerous possibilities of profiting in the market. IT REALLY IS A PATIENCE GAME. THE KEY IS THAT OTHER TRADERS BECOME IMPATIENT TOO. So if I'm playing the same game as they are and am trying to close for a profit as soon as possible, they will stop me out at least 80% of the time. But if I play a different game where I don't have to profit immediately, then they will get bored and focus on what other traders are doing in the market!

The hard part about this is that now I can't trade MES until either price comes back around and I close for a small profit or I accept the loss. I disobeyed the rule of ""Never let a day trade become a swing trade."" Although I never planned to enter into this trade. So lessons being learned. Thank God this is a simulator trade.

It's way more, ""Where are we in a specific cycle of a specific financial instrument, what profitable decisions can be made within this cycle, and from these decisions, what decisions can I make that are effective for my personalities (strengths + interests).

And the aha moment is that setting prices doesn't make sense because a financial instrument may not be able to tick to a custom price!

That said, in my live account I won't be able to do a trade like this because it'll blow up my account. I'll get margin called and won't be able to keep trading. Anyway, a bullish breakout has happened and is continuing!",N 
/ES,11/2/23,9:17 AM,"I entered long on the ES based on the bullish breakout still happening. I entered at 4301.75 on the daily chart. Price is back at supply and seems like it may be breaking through supply. Everything is way easier when the market is in play! On the 1hr chart, price had a consolidation at $4260 at 6pm on 11/2/2023 @ 6pm and kept going up to $4300 this morning. I imagine we'll see $4333 again. On 15m chart, price has nice consolidation around $4300 and has gas to push through resistance at $4310.  ",Y
/MCL,11/2/23,9:25 AM,"Price has fallen through the demand zone I drew (I should have went short!) and bounced off $80 on the daily chart. Observe how MCL is not correlated with ES! Current price is 81.40. Strong rejection at 80.23. Also, resistance at $82. Price is range trading in a weird way where price direction isn't clear on 1hr. On 15m price is much clearer and typical of MCL. Price reached a high of ~$82, and fell back to 15m demand at $81.20. This requires waiting until the market determines price direction to make a trade. Could go back to $81 or back to $82",Y

I'll wait a bit to see what price is doing. The dopamine hit is real. Also, I have some mindset issues to resolve because it's like I'm trying to balance my account back to $0 instead of profit.

I wouldn't trade this because while candlestick bodies are bullish this price movement is similar to what I've seen sometimes on MCL where the choppiness easily reverses a trade, creating multiple stop losses, and causing confusion. 15m and 5m charts show the same choppiness.

Daily Reflection,11/2/23,12:47 AM,"Today was incredibly humbling 🙏. I finally reached my point of failure & exhaustion, in both my spirit and my mind. This is where growth truly occurs. I was down at an unrealized loss of -$4000 on the ES and I started questioning whether or not God loves me & my family (even though I know in my heart that God always loves us. God loves everyone and the entire world, including all living beings, and including the entire universe or universes or however the inifinite works.). It wasn't so much being down -$4000. It was that I entered into what was (at the time) a high-quality, high-probability, scaled up trade, where I was super excited that I was starting to grasp how scaling works in practice and how hedging works in practice. As soon as I entered and had it on my mind this plan of earning $5000 from the bullish momentum and being able to close my accidental MES trade that I, being foolish and undisciplined, allowed to become a swing trade with a significant loss of -$1400, price consolidated and started reversing. And I really thought, ""Why me and my family?"" ""Why is it that Joovier on YouTube is like, 'And I just made another $11000 on the YM!' and I'm down several thousand (unrealized) and my mom is suffering and didn't return to work because people mistreated her. Am I not a good person? Am I a bad person? I know I've done some bad things, including watching porn. But what about all of the good I've done and how I've focused on giving to many people & organizations without asking in return."" This point of failure pushed me into thinking about David's messages from Psalms where we get to see how he wrestled with his battles. How he was afraid and questioned God, wondering why God let his enemies close in on him. And how this is how David felt even though the Lord kept delivering him. Even though the Lord kept fighting his battles and allowing victories. I felt human like David. And I wanted to give up. I even thought, ""All I want to do is give this to other people, beautiful people so we can restore kindness, respect, and creativity to the world. And yet how can I give Financial Prosperity to others if I can't even attain & experience it myself."" And in that moment I let go and I trusted God. Not explicitly. I didn't say, ""I'm letting go and trusting God."" I just kind of felt, ""I've waited twice now for price to break through and there's not even solid historical resistance at $4320. Price should be able to easily break through to $4333 and above to $4340. Price is climbing back up towards $4320 again. This time I'll let go, see what happens, and close the trade if I'm wrong."" And in letting go, I focused my mind on inspirational videos from some of my heroes instead of the market - videos named ""To Push Past Your Limits"" and ""Give It Your All"". These videos reminded me to keep putting in the work. They reminded me of the hard times David Goggins went through to acquire his strength. They reminded me of what Mike Tyson said about the importance of discipline. They reminded me of what Kevin Hart said about how hard it is to show up and give something your all, your 100% and not see results. And to feel that pain deep down of, ""That was my best."" and to dig deep and find it within yourself to show back up the next day and go harder! And I'm finding myself again! I remember now what my college roommate Obinna said to me after I failed my first physics exam in September 2008 at MIT and said, ""I tried my best."" He said: ""You don't know what your best is!"" and encouraged me to keep going! It's been a really long time since I've tried my best at something and failed or felt like a failure. In letting go, price came back around a brought bullish momentum. I was able to close my scaled-up trade for a profit of $1000+ and cover my accidental swing trade, ending the day with a gross profit of $250 (my goal for the week!). Also, I checked my weekly P&L and I actually ended this week with $860.50 gross profit and $740.84 net profit! Tomorrow I will rest because I've accomplished what I needed to (through God)!",Y
Opening Daily Reflection,11/6/23,10:43 AM,"Today I am sleepy and showing up super late to the market. Still, I'm excited! I want to focus on news this week and expanding my knowledge around trading best practices as I start designing & building The Fin Tea. My specific question is: ""How do I know when a financial instrument is in play and how can I find why it's in play?"" When a financial instrument isn't in play it's hard for me to trad it profitable. When it's in play it's easy for me to trade it profitably. So my initial question is: ""What happened last week that made the e-mini S&P 500 futures easy to trade?"" ",Y
News Update,11/6/23,10:56 AM,"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20231101a.htm – last week's bullish momentum on the e-mini S&P 500 futures was driven by the Fed's announcement on Nov 1 that they will maintain Federal Funds rate at 5-1/4-to 5-1/2%. Experts expected this. Somehow this also in part seems to have caused a decrease in Crude Light Oil futures prices and an Increase in Natural Gas futures prices, but I would argue that Natural Gas prices are up seasonally because it's cold now (need to verify). The Fed is selling its holdings of US Treasury Securities (bonds) and Agency debt/mortgage-backed securities (bonds) and has been announcing this. What will be the economic effect of wrapping up these bond sales? Who is buying them?  ",Y
/MES,11/6/23,11:01 AM,"MES is no longer in play on the daily chart (really low volume (388,000 so far relative to 898,000 on Friday, which was about average). MES is also back trading at supply with a current price of $4381. So the learning here is that I can't scale up right now! I can trade, but I can't scale up if MES isn't in play). I'm in tune! On the hourly chart price is flat and has remained flat at 4375-4380 since 11/3 @ 3pm. I was feeling lame and undisciplined for not waking up at 7am to trade this morning, but because of being in tune I didn't actually miss anything! There are no high-probability trades on MES right now. On the 15m chart, price is super choppy and would easily stop me out ",Y
/ES,11/6/23,11:16 AM,"Also, *patience*! Thursday was a really good trading day because God saved me and acknowledged my trust, letting go, and patience. While I was exhausted and sold the ES early due to emotional fatigue around $4325 instead of my original plan of $4340 and then my adjusted plan of $4331, price reached a high of $4333 on 11/2 @12pm so more patience would have netted me another $3000 in profit). That said, I'm grateful for the profit I received knowing that I also could have closed the daily easily at a $4000 loss! Also, observe that I was incredibly wrong about price returning to $4175 in the short-term, especially based on the news from the Fed that interest rate hikes have stopped for now. Instead of only basing cycles in price movement on technical analysis, the news informs the cause-effect relationships that determine the timeline of when cycles will be repeated. The S&P 500 dipping into correction territory plus bullish news from the Fed will keep the S&P 500 high for a while until economic conditions change again ",Y
/MCL,11/6/23,11:25 AM,"MCL is also not in play today. Price is holding at demand/support of $80/bbl. People keep saying news-wise that crude oil prices are going up because of supply tightening, but the reality of recent price movements doesn't reflect this. Price kind of head & shoulders'd. If price does fall through support at $80, we could see a retest of $78, then $74, and then $70. This week it's more likely to see price return to $85 before seeing another selling off back to $80",Y
/NG,11/6/23,11:41 AM,"Price gapped down from a close of 3.473 (per unit?) on 11/3/2023 to 3.373 today! So from a technical analysis perspective, without knowing why the gap down occurred, I'm expecting a gap up. I'll find news to see if supply of natural gas increased or if demand somehow decreased (unlikely because it's cold and people still need to eat!). Similar to crude oil futures, NG price is decreasing close to support/demand at 3.200 (3.216 precisely). Are they correlated? Intuitively it would make sense that there's some correlation between crude oil & natural gas because the same people tend to produce them (i.e. The industry is Oil & Gas, not the Oil industry and the Gas industry). NG is actually in play! On 1hr a nice selloff from 3.397 @5am  to 3.259 at 11am). Price has since cooled off at $3.253. Actually, not much activity on NG since 10:45 am  ",Y
/MYM,11/6/23,12:34 PM,Micro e-mini Dow Futures are also not in play today and are also oscillating in a very tight range at supply after an incredibly bullish week! ,Y
Closing Daily Reflection,11/6/23,12:39 PM,"More to learn! My initial  trading goal of $50/day / $250/week doesn't exactly make sense - it depends on market conditions. Trading is hunter-gathering, not 9-to-5. There are periods there are really big harvest opportunities like last week. And there are periods like today where there's no food (volume) in the market. I would have to force a trade to happen. There's even a weird gap down happening on the *15m chart* of MES because volume is so low. Knowing when to turn it on and turn it off is *key*!  ",Y
Opening Daily Reflection,11/7/23,10:05 AM,"Still sleepy today. (It's because of the emotional pain of wrapping things up with my ex-wife. The pain won't go away until her belongings are picked up & shipped back to France. Also, I need to get things notarized. Also, this is why I feel horny and in the mood for sex. It's because I feel like crap about the loss of love and feel (mistakenly) that a sexual act will heal the pain. It will distract me from the pain. It won't heal the pain. Only God can heal the pain. (Not to say that I shouldn't have sex (I should if I want to and can). It's just that the sex won't heal the pain, which is what I want.). I woke up at 7am! And yet I had reflections about what decisions to make regarding my trading journey (including The Fin Tea!) that I wanted to focus on for a bit. I recognize that my mindset has to change and is changing. People like Shay (humbled trader) are talking about how they made $10k in *one* trade that happened around 9am so there was still time to go to work (she's also working on bringing more people into financial markets to  prosper from the additional income that trading can give. It's the same as inviting more people to participate in doing real estate business. It's hard to motivate people to do these things because of the societal system in place of designed ignorance). My mindset is still on, ""How can I make $10k-$20k a month to pay my bills and still enjoy life?"" In reality, it's doable to breakthrough this limit and make $10k or more in a day if I desire it. Shay's friend/fellow 8-figure trader Lance spoke about 10 years having monthly trading profit targets of $60k, where he was risking at most $5k-10k a day. Be willing to have $60k profit months or $100k profit months or more. Don't let the mediocrity of society hold me back anymore. Think about it: What has the average 9-to-5 salary mindset and lifestyle brought me? I wasn't able to enjoy my passion for music early in my career and am just now getting back to it. I wasn't able to get a girlfriend for A LONG TIME so doing what everyone else is doing didn't help me romantically. I eventually found one girlfriend who almost rejected me. We got married and then she eventually abandoned me and we got divorced. I also wasn't able to spend time with my family because of time + financial constraints and also identity shifts. Not enough vacation time to see my family. Not enough financial resources to easily afford trips. And I lost the deep connection I had with my family members just to embrace a corporate identity that didn't me the identity, time, and money to do what I love to do in life.  On top of all of that, for most of my early career I had to show up to an office even though my actual work can be done from many locations. And in my previous role (9-to-5), even though I got paid a high salary I suffered from toxicity, energy depletion, and time poverty. I couldn't serve in the way I wanted at work. Most people did actually have small minds (even encouraging people to tap into their imagination to provide value instead of focusing on doing more bureaucracy was like impossible for them, which was sad). This was sad & frustrating to experience because I hadn't truly experienced small-minded-ness in my career until that role. It was like I sold out on all of the good spirit & identity of all that I loved from MIT, especially making the world a better place... and just for a little bit of money. I was too tired after to do what I love doing (e.g. Playing/Writing music, and reading! I actually reached a point of being too tired to read because of the job!). And people were often doing mean things to each other. So it wasn't much of a life. Yet, because of bad habits and identity reinforcement, I keep trying to go back to it in terms of my goals instead of surrounding myself with people, like Carmine, who are doing what I actual want to do, have been doing so for years, and do so full time! What is it socially that I'm trying to hold onto unconsciously that makes me so desperately want to bring people along from my old life instead of embracing my new life and being okay with journeying with new people or alone if I have to?

News Update,11/7/23,10:31 AM,"Most of the market is still not in play and trading in a very tight range after last week's bullish news. This is across MES, and MYM. Today MCL is tanking and fell through to $78 as I had planned for but didn't capture! Why is MCL down? The World Bank actually sees a decrease in oil prices as economic growth slows (less demand). They're targeting $81/bbl in 2024. The key events that could cause oil price to jump up to $100+/bbl again is if oil supply is cut off due to global conflicts such as what's happening between Israel & Hamas – https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/world-bank-sees-oil-lower-2024-wider-middle-east-war-could-spike-them-2023-10-30/#:~:text=The%20World%20Bank%20said%20on,could%20spike%20prices%20significantly%20higher.

On the 1hr chart, there was a nice bullish move from ~4370 to $4400 from 5am to 10am. If I had entered at 8am around 4380, I could have done a $100 trade (which is okay because I'm back to being scaled down). On the 15m chart, this bullish price movement didn't start until 9am. On 5m chart, price is trading in a narrow range",Y

Went short for a lower price move towards $74. On the 1hr chart the sell off actually started at 12am. RSI is low at a ridiculous 17, but the bigger picture bearish trajectory of crude oil, without a global conflict that will disrupt supply, is clear. ",Y
/NG,11/7/23,11:10 AM,"On the daily chart, price is falling and has fallen through support at 3.216! I also planned for this yesterday! The next support/demand zone is at 2.939, even though price bounced at 3.099. Feels like price will sell off further. I should have set an automated sell order at 3.216 lol. On the hourly chart the big sell off happened at 6am and the bounce off 3.099 happened at 8am. On the 15m chart price is selling off again after reaching a high of 3.188 and will probably retest 3.099 soon. Current price is 3.146.

Closing Daily Reflection,11/7/23,12:14 AM,"Today was another really good learning day! I ended the day with a gross profit of $61 (~$57 net profit) and brought my demo account back to a small net profit of $11.35. I CAN DO THIS! While the profits are great, it's really the learning & growth that motivate me. It's the pain! Like Lance Breitstein was saying. The *growth comes from pain*! That $1470 loss I suffered from an accidental trade brought me into a *Can't Hurt Me* state where being down a few dollars on MCL or down $60 on NG no longer phases me. That's what really excited me today more than the wins (even though I'm grateful to God for the wins because each win brings more freedom - freedom to serve God, freedom to create, and freedom to enjoy life!). A key question is: ""Can I endure something big (to me) like losing $120k on a trade within a few minutes and find it within myself to keep going?"" ""Can I be like Ray Dalio and lose my entire firm (millions of dollars) based on the economy recovering after former President Nixon reneged on the gold standard, having traded short that the economy would shrink, become so broken & defeated & humbled to have to borrow $4000 from my dad, and find it deep within myself to *keep going*?"" My trades today were of okay quality. I really liked that I checked the news on crude oil and saw that demand is decreasing as economic growth cools off. I also really liked learning that higher oil & gas prices increase food prices (inflation). Today I felt like the big picture trends of my trades were high quality and that my entrances & exits could be improved. My MCL entrance was good & my exit was premature because I became impatient (could have made ~$50 just on my MCL trade). My NG entrance was bad and my exit was good. I entered into NG at a balanced price level where the odds of price moving up or down are 50:50, which is bad (no edge). I should have waited for confirmation of the larger bearish trend. Having *patience* on this trade is what prevented me from stopping out at a $60 loss instead of closing at a $40 profit.

This tells me I'm on the right path to giving Financial Prosperity to 1M+ people in service of the Lord. I'm just as grateful that Yang & I are on this journey together and that Yang is someone who's a brilliant Data Engineer who's also excited about Trading, Investing, and contributing to society at scale through ESG, specifically social good 🙏. The Fin Tea is totally about social good in terms of increasing people's knowledge & skill within Trading & Investing (Financial Literacy) while deflating the learning curve. I'm just as grateful for the time spent with Huw and Perry yesterday because a little bit at a time, as we share energy, I'm growing into someone who can create & operate a company, which is an entirely separate skill set from creating technology that makes peoples lives easier within a specific domain. Now, I feel undisciplined (impatient) because I've been waking up really late this entire week, which is ironic because of the extra hour from Daylight Savings Time ending. I haven't worked out this week or ran. Yet I have to give myself grace (as God does) that I was (and maybe still am?) sick and also I'm still dealing with the emotional pain of wrapping up things with Gaelle. Removing her belongings from the closet and putting them in the living room to be shipped back to France really did rip off a bandaid on an old wound. *This is part of the healing process*. I have to remind myself that I'm doing a good job and that it's okay and good to *heal*. Sometimes *healing* requires having a day off to recover from being sick instead of pushing myself. Sometimes *healing* requires allowing myself to sleep & wake up when my body wants to. Sometimes *healing* requires accepting the times I give into sin as I fight to untangle where I am in life and what I truly want. Yesterday, while off from trading, was a beautiful day in terms of reflection on what I truly appreciate: *Service*. It helped me understand that some of my bad habits are tangled within the good of feeling truly served and appreciated! So the question is: How can I find more ways to feel truly served & appreciated within society in ways that are good for society and the community?

/MCL,11/10/23,10:30 AM,"MCL reached a low of 75.21 yesterday! And current price is 77.12. Price is heading towards 74 from a bigger picture trend perspective. I really missed a larger sell off from where I drew demand. If I had gone short on 10/30 at $82 with a swing trade, I'd be up about $500 now, with 1 contract. 1hr chart shows resistance at 77.17 being retested. Price seems to be heading back up towards $80 - may go long. 15m chart is choppy but there's an overall bullish trend. Going long towards $80/bbl ",Y
/NG,11/10/23,10:36 AM,"NG is right in the middle of a sell of still, but there's momentum is slowing and showing signs of a reversal at a low of 2.989. NG has a weighted price of 3.014 right now on 1hr chart. Current price is 3.030 with a small sell off occuring from 3.077. The macro economics for natural gas is that it's cold so demand should be increasing even if supply is also increasing (which I'm pretty sure it's not). So I want to wait for signs (extra confirmation of a reversal) and ride price back to 3.120. The restest of 3.077 will be key. Pay attention because I could be wrong and this sell off could be continuing (gapping down) to 2.939 (mind the gap). If I go long and I'm wrong and price gaps down it would be a significant loss of $750. If I'm right, it would be an upside of $950. Need to wait on this one (or be okay with 3.030 to 3.077, which would be $400+). 15m chart shows that price is currently at support and 3.020. Same on 5m chart. Need to wait for confirmation ",Y
/MCL,11/10/23,10:37 AM,"Saw price went up *really* quickly and exited for a profit of $43 (net profit $42). I don't really play with MCL so when unusual things happen, I exit. That said, this was a great opportunity to apply a trailing stop (which I will learn about today!) ",Y
/MYM,11/10/23,10:57 AM,Current price 34082 and the Dow is still trading in a very tight range. 1hr chart is choppy with range from 33912 to 34128 (~$100). 15m shows price near resistance of 34128. There may be a sell off trade opportunity back towards 34018 (just above the close of the bullish momentum candle).,Y

Intra Daily Reflection,11/10/23,11:30 AM,It's Veterans' Day! God bless our veterans for their service to us and the protection we've received from them! It makes sense that fewer people are trading today. This is the news! This is what the woman on Bumble I was speed-chatting with was talking about in terms of having Friday off!,Y
Trailing Stops!,11/10/23,1:25 PM,Breakthrough! And a few things to unpack here. Trailing stops are effective for trend/momentum trades with clear exits. THIS IS WHAT I WANTED WITH FCEL AND DIDN'T GRASP BACK THEN! Today's /MES plan is a good example (even though I didn't execute this trade). Say I had entered at 4380 at 10am and rode price to 4400. If I had set a trailing sell stop at 4400 instead of a regular sell stop at 4400 then there's a chance I would have exited at 4410 instead of 4400. I'll have to try/test this because Ninja Trader said that the default trailing stop is one tick at a time - not ideal because prices fluctuate multiple ticks all the time before there are signfiicant price movements. It's a recipe for a trade exit to occur consistently at the original price of the trailing stop. Need to test this and explore advanced trailing stops! Doe Ninja Trader have replay?,Y
Closing Daily Reflection,11/10/23,11:57 AM,"I'm calling it for the day and I feel good! Today was a really good trading day because I overcame my emotions. Even just a few minutes ago, I had FOMO around bullish price movement on MES. I missed my trade entrance mostly because I started my trading day late. If I had already done market analysis by 8am, then there would have been many more profitable trading opprotunities and I would have been able to enter MES at 10am around 4380 and run up to $4400 for a nice $100. What ended up happening is that by the time I saw price heading towards $4400, it was ~$4390 and the reward wasn't worth the risk. I didn't know and didn't plan for price to reach $4415. I planned for price reaching $4400 at supply and then probably selling back off a bit even though it was a bullish day. This was because there was a larger loop/price movement that MES completed at $4400. So despite wanting to enter at $4410 because price just kept going up, I acknowledged that I had no plan at that point and would have been winging it. My other main financial instruments didn't have a lot of volume & price movement today so I mostly didn't trade. I may add one more financial instrument to my trade list. I did one trade today and it was a good trade because I exited well based on intuition. I entered into MCL at 77.12 with the intention of riding the wave back to 80 (which I believe will happen by next week). Price shot up really fast and I know MCL doesn't tend to trade that way so I closed my trade for a nice gross profit of $43 and a net profit of $42. And I'm satisfied with that. What I'm not yet satisfied with is that I didn't learn how to do trailing stops in Ninja trader yet, which I'lll do now! Also, performance-wise, this week I earned $184 in gross profit and $170.16 net profit. This is good considering there was low market activity, knowing that I got sick and botched a trade I should have earned $230 on instead of $80, knowing that I allowed myself a day off to rest, and that Thursday I had mastermind activities plus also didn't trade to allow myself to recover!

Opening Daily Reflection,11/13/23,8:24 AM,"I'm ready to start the week again with live trades! Carmine really inspired me yesterday and I feel welcomed by the community!

I'm awake at a disciplined time to make high-quality trades today!",Y
/MES,11/13/23,8:29 AM,Current price is 4415. MES is still trading near supply of 4430 on the daily chart. Price still tightly consolidated. Remember to be careful about trading in this range based on what Carmine said. Going long would be a trap based on the 10/12 high of 4430 and the 10/17 high of 4423 before price started selling off. 1hr chart shows a high of 4425 at 5am and a low of 4409 yesterday at 11pm. 15m chart shows a sell off occurring from 4425 towards 4409 starting at 7:30. 5m chart shows the same with heavy consolidation around 4415 and price selling off starting at 8:30 am. Will price head back towards 4380?,Y
/MCL,11/13/23,8:37 AM,Current price 77.72. MCL is on the rise again! But mostly trading in a consolidated range. It's taking longer than expected to return to 80. 1hr chart shows significant bullish volume at 8am (essentially a repeat of the trade I had on Friday from 77.12 - 77.53). High of 77.81. 5m chart shows a small sell off forming after a high of 77.77. We're at resistance now. So the question is whether price will break through or if it will sell off again. The overall trend is long ,Y
/NG,11/13/23,8:44 AM,"Current price 3.183. NG stepped in with significant bullish price movement today opening at 3.064! So the reversal did happen, but I missed it! Actually, I didn't miss it. 1hr chart shows a gap up at 5pm yesterday (market open) followed by a bullish rally. Price actually reached a high of 3.217 this morning at 7am and sold off to 3.147 before bouncing and rallying again. NG is in play! 15m chart shows the bounce started happening at 8:15am ",Y

/NG,11/13/23,9:04 AM,"Progress! I saw a wrap up of a small short back to the mean (mean reversion) from 3.192 to 3.165 and decided to enter after seeing price break the low of 3.173. I exited promptly at 3.164 for a gross profit of $50. This wasn't the most high quality trade because I wasn't sure what my stop loss should have been and price was already trading so close to a consolidated range that it's like I missed most of the trade already. Still, I'm happy about my exit as price is going back up. The true progress is that I traded NG live with full leverage today! What I love about this is that my time spent in the simulator is paying off! *Never underestimate training & practicing before the real game!* That's the lesson!",Y
/NG,11/13/23,10:29 AM,"I learned something new from *not* entering a trade! And I learned a reason why I tend to trade sideways! Today I traded NG based on ""reverse momentum(?)"". I saw a large bullish candle that felt overextended relative to the other candles. That and because of the larger trend I believed there would be a sell off. I didn't enter well, but I got in and got out at the close of the reversal of this candle. Then, at 10:10am, the opposite occurred! I wanted to enter because price fell through the low of 3.136 which was a bearish signal because there was a strong rejection at 3.136 so I was expecting price to hold. Price fell through 3.136 very quickly (within 5m) creating a *short overextended candle*. And I wanted to go short at 3.130 towards 3.115, and my intuition told me not to even though my dopamine desire told me yes. In hindsight, that overextended short candle was followed by by significant bullish price movement that essentially canceled that overextended price movement, and this happens all the time! Had I entered at 3.130 and not had a good stop in place. I would be down $200 on that trade. So I'm happy that today I'm keeping my profits #progress",Y
Closing Daily Reflection,11/13/23,11:00 AM,"So many good things happened today! Carmine & Dylan's trading community is exactly what I've needed to keep growing! Unfortunately the people in my previous role truly did get under my skin and because of their influence I really did start believing there was somehow merit in mediocrity. That mediocrity was the winning path. And that being closed-minded, having a big ego, and thinking small were somehow driving success (even though I knew deep down that these ingredients don't drive long-term success). The trading community! Where people are open-minded, have small egos, think BIG, and want to support each other is life changing in a positive way! We're all improving together, already! Also, I kept my profits today! I could have easily lost $200-$300 on NG after earning $50 just because of not controlling my emotions. Instead of re-entering to get another dopamine hit (like Adam Fiske warned about), I sat backed and really payed attention to what's happening in the market, (like Carmine has said about the market telling a story). The stories are becoming easier to read! It's really nice keeping my profits today and improving with the group! Also, it's cool to see how different instruments trade. Like JayNTX did about the same multiple as I did, but he did so in a way where he received 10x more leverage on his profits! This is awesome and a really great lesson about the hope the future holds! While I'm glad that I didn't trade MES or ES today, I would have totally traded MES while I'm still learning & developing my MES/ES edge, which would have yielded in profits the  same $50 that I earned from NG, but in a more efficient way because I can increase leverage moving from MES to ES, whereas I can't increase leverage from NG. Super excited about The Fin Tea! Also, CaptJames had good insights on NEE options, citing that energy stocks are good because bond yields went up, options are cheap, and the price moves are slower/more methodical!",Y
Opening Daily Reflection,11/14/23,7:54 AM,"I feel energized this morning from running yesterday! I also feel energized from being part of the Investitrade Trading community and learning from Dylan! It's true that life is funner *when we're doing the same thing* with likeminded people. Today I'm checking specifically how the market responds to the CPI report! I'm feeling grateful about the process of learning how to trade effectively! I'm also feeling a bit overwhelmed lol. Trading is an actual job that requires actual skill. It's not easy money. Also, I finally understand more & more that designed ignorance plays a key role in more people not being successful in financial markets. Whereas there is a degree for computer science and companies and job fairs with a clear path to help people become professional software engineers, there is no such path for becoming a professional trader (or if there is, it's not obvious). I have a feeling that I can study finance in college to learn about accounting and company valuations to become a financial analyst at a bank.

/MES,11/14/23,8:05,"Current price $4484. The market is FAST. I missed the CPI news by 30min and the market already went up from 4420 to 4484, breaking through supply and forming a new zone! The daily chart shows we're heading back towards 44560. 1hr chart shows that significant price movement happened at 7am so there could be a sell off. 15m chart shows that the move happened right at 7:30am when the report was released. Also, observe that price shook out traders before going up! Price was at 4430 and dipped into 4420 before going up to 4480. It's a calculated price move. A new base has formed with resistance at 4490. 5m chart shows that most of the gas happened within a very short time frame (between 7:30am-7:35am), which is a really good sign that this move is not over! MES is still in play. I need to watch carefully for a reversal or a continuation. A reversal towards 4460 feels more likely because price went up fast or price will continue to climb back to 4500.

/ES,11/14/23,10:52 AM,"I ended up going long on the ES at ~4501 and exiting around ~4506 for an almost 5 point bullish profit! This was a really good trade for me because my psychology improved! The millionaire trader Shay (Humbled Trader) was interviewing got to me in her recent YouTube video that I saw last night. He said something like, ""If you're too afraid to risk enough money to make it worthwhile in transitioning from 9-to-5 to being a fulltime trader then you'll never make it."" So I decided to jump into the water and swim instead of sinking! I totally feel God's help and blessings in making all this work so I definitely want to say the glory goes to God! So instead of keeping my risk as small as possible on bullish movement supported by CPI, *I dedcided to trade the ES and had a psychological breakthrough*! The ES is fine as long as there's *confirmation*. Today, while I missed the incredible (and fast!) bullish move from 4420 to 4500, I saw that 4500 is a key price level like Dylan was saying! So I waited for price to break through 4500 (there were so many retests of 4500) to go long. My intuition was that because bulls are hammering 4500 even though there are many limit orders at 4500, as soon as price breaks through, price will take off and have support at 4500. Things went almost as planned! There was a sell off after I entered and I was down ~$112 for a split second. Then price did hold at 4500 and started going up towards 4510 which is where I was originally planning to exit. I instead exited around 4506 because *I had reached a new milestone* in earning $200+ on a single trade! So I exited for a gross profit of $237.50 and a net profit of $231.92! I have mixed feelings about the trade because price sold off back towards 4502 after I exited making me feel good about where I exited and now price is back up to 4515, having reached a high of 4520! That said, today was a huge milestone moment because a month ago I said to myself that I wanted to earn $50 a day and $250 a week! Now I'm close to earning $250 in a day! (WITH ROOM TO SCALE UP). All of the learning and practice and discipline and my Investitrade trading teachers and our trading community  is paying off! My live account is back to being profitable (way more profitable than when I was up $18 net and thought I had an edge)! I can actually pay myself out from today if I want! Also, between earning $50 yesterday and $237 today, I'm up close to $300 for the week, surpassing my goal of earning $250/week! I have to keep going and keep improving and keep working on my risk management! More than anything, I'm happy to be experiencing a significant change in mindset that I'm so excited to bring to others as we give people Financial Prosperity through The Fin Tea!",Y
/NG,11/14/23,11:10 AM,"I returned to the simulator after my profitable ES trade to remain humble, keep practicing, and refrain from dopamine-based trading. Also, my mind was feeling a bit worn after the nice ES trade! Also, while I can feel the market's energy, (4512, eh-hem!), there are still limits to my own energy and how much my mind can handle. So I went back to the simulator to practice good risk management and to remain safe in case I overdid it psychologically. I entered NG sloppily (early) at 3.156 after seeing two capitulations during the day with the most recent bouncing higher at 3.131. So I entered to do a range trade towards 3.189, even though price was currently bearish (THIS WAS BAD). I set an automated exit at 3.189 and a psychological stop loss at 3.144. My psychological stop loss got hit. *The market aimed to stop me out (or it felt that way)*. Because of the capitulations I had seen and knowing we were making higher lows, and because I was in the simulator, I hung on through an unrealized loss of $120. Then price kicked back in and I was up $60. I reached my psychological limit and exited the trade for a $60 profit. This trade was bad from an entry and exit standpoint. I should have waited for bullish momentum to enter and I should have found the psychological fortitude and persistence to at least get to 3.172 before exiting (exited at 3.162). Then I would have exited at a $160 profit, making the actual trade reward-risk closer to 2:1, whereas my actual trade reward-risk ended up being 1:2, with a profit of $60 and a risk of $120. So more improvement is needed. Still, it's exciting to see my progress and to know that, through God, we at The Fin Tea will be able to help a ton of people be able to do this as well!",Y

Soon I will have to set new milestones! Also what Kevin Hart said is true: ""The hardest part is showing up and giving it 100% of your ability and not seeing results. And then having to find it within ourselves to go even harder the next day!"" So much of this is about psychological energy, mindset, and knowledge. It's not just knowing it's possible to earn $200+ on a trade or $2000+ on a trade of $20k+ on a single trade, or even $200k+ on a single trade – it's also about believing that I can and that others can too! I need to be careful about entering into trades that are likely to be stopped out, like what I saw on NG. Also, I need to see how I can improve on these news-based, in-play, price moves (CPI happens once a month). Rememember to learn about PPI!. Why did I feel 4506 was a good exit? Why did that turn out to be true in the short term (next 10min or so) and why did that turn out to be false over the next hour or so? Would it have made sense on my first ES trade to stay in and hold until 4515, risking the loss of most of my profits when I was up $200+? Was I impatient today in my exit?

At the same time, the more information I ingest, including CPI reports, PPI reports, how they correlate with market prices, etc. the more mentally fatigued I feel. That said, here I am showing up!

What would invalidate this move? A break above 422.75 would invalidate the move. Yeah, price is holding at 4520 and bouncing so it's a really good entry to go short if price falls through.

/MES,11/15/23,9:40 AM,"I went short on MES at 4518.50 at 8:16 AM with a thesis that price would head back to 4512-4510 if price fell through 4520. I was wrong. It turned out to be a fake/liquidity trap before the market went higher. I thought hard about what Dylan said about: ""How much are you comfortable risking?"" And my answer, today, based on market conditions, felt like $50. AND IT WORKS! While $50 ended up being my max risk, which clued me into scaling down to trading MES instead of ES, my actual trade risk ended up being $20, which was 4 points. Not exactly sure how I arrived at that, but it was something like 4520 is a key level and price was at ~4522, which told me that 4520 was still acting as support rather than resistance. I stayed in the trade until 8:28 AM (~12min) and stopped out. THIS WAS GOOD RISK MANAGEMENT. Although it's been a range-trading day on MES, price continued higher and I would have lost a lot more. If I had traded the ES I would have been down $200 without having the emotional strength to stay focused on high quality trades afterwards. Price ended up going to a high of 4535 which I'm actually happy about because a friend of mine named DSO from our trading community had a big win today because of it! ",Y

It's true that psychologically I started thinking about how I could earn back my loss. I covered at 8:44 AM at 4524.25 for really almost break even. This wasn't a good trade.

Price went to a new low of say 4517. Instead of going short again, I recognized that it was another liquidity trap and went long at 4519.00 at 8:54 AM. I exited within a minute at a 4521.25 for a nice $10+ profit! The range-trading pattern of the day helped me see this price move. Now, I exited way too early and could have held through the pain towards a nice 10 point profit at 4529, but I didn't want to endure the pain of another loss after the $15 I would have had on my previous trade.

THIS SOMEHOW MESSED UP THE TRADING FLOW ON NG. I have no idea how to explain this, but price didn't budge from 3.182 after I set my alerts. I kept checking NG for about 30min for an entry and price hadn't budged. I removed my alerts and price sold off to my entry within 5m after that (it required that I check price manually). It was super weird!!! Anyway, I entered at 3.170 at 9:04 AM, where I expected and I exited early for a 5-point profit that could have been 6 points randomly and 10 points had I hung in there. NG still makes me feel anxious because of the amount of leverage. This tells me I should spend more time trading NG in the simulator. Still, this was a good trade and it put me back into a gross profit of $43.75 for the day and a net profit of $32.61 for the day after fees",Y
Closing Daily Reflection,11/15/23,10:17 AM,"Today was a good day considering that market conditions were not ideal for my trading style. I decided to call it after 4 trades because of that because I didn't want to over trade. While $32.61 net profit for the day feels small emotionally, it feels much better than the $200+ loss I easily would have suffered had I scaled up to trading the ES during uncertain market conditions where I wasn't sure if I had an edge. So today was an excellent risk management day. And, gratefully, I ended the day with a bit more net profit *that I can actually pay out to pay for life*!!! My account is currently up to $2206.19, which is $206.19 net profit on my initial account value. I'm up 10%+ and feeling good. I'm extremely happy that I stopped listening to people who are playing the social game of ""You can't beat the market"". I'm making progress 🙏. All thanks and glory goes to God! Also, I had a larger non-equities-trading reflection that our US capitalist society tends towards trading because a lot of the system is unfair. I learned yesterday that Home Equity Loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit aren't real because even though people say they're backed by your home, you need consistent income to obtain them, which really says that they're backed by income. Also, home sale proceeds are taxed at ordinary income tax rates unless the money is put towards a new home. So unless you flip homes (which is trading) then selling a home after holding it for many years becomes a bad deal. It all points back to time poverty. The system is well designed to keep people time poor. Same with personal loans. You can't get a personal loan unless you already have money lol. And if you already have money then you don't need a loan lol. So trading is a legitimate time-wealth solution for people who lean towards the sigma spectrum. I really like it. Also, I'm really excited about gamifying The Fin Tea! It's amazing to see my trading progress 1.5 months in! A month ago I just wanted to earn $50 a day and now I'm eyeing $250+ earnings days which tells me that soon enough I'll be acustomed to  $250+ earnings days and will be eyeing $1000+ earnings days, aiming for $5000+ weeks. And then it'll be $10000+ weeks and not only will my life change for the positive but, through God, I'll be able to help change so many other people's lives for the positive, including my family!",Y
Opening Daily Reflection,11/17/23,8:10 AM,"I'm back and refreshed after a day off from trading. Trading is like working out! Just as the body needs rest (e.g. rotating chest days with leg days and cardio days), the mind needs rest from trading to recover. Also, because of Carmine I'm coming back to the market much stronger today! *Trading is like making shots in basketball*. Right now I'm learning what shots (trades) I'm good and making and how often I can make them. And I'm *developing a system for risk managing shots (trades)*. Right now I'm comfortable risking max $50 per trade to earn $100 per trade because that's where my shots are performance-wise. On Wednesday, I missed a shot on MES and lost $20, which I was okay with because it was my planned risk. Then I ended up earning $60 on my next 3 shots, giving me a win rate of 75% and ending the way up $30 in net profit. It's a tiny amount of profit and yet it's teaching me how to grow & scale!",Y

/MES,11/17/23,8:32 AM,"On the daily chart price is still trading in a very narrow range (BE CAREFUL). Yesterday price ranged from 4501-4529.50 after opening 4514.50. Today price opened at 4528 and reached a high of 4539 before selling off to a current price low of 4519.50. It's another range-trading day and price direction is currently unclear to me . Will price bounce soon? There's probably a nice ride back up to 4530. Or we could see 4501 again. Have to wait. 1hr chart shows the same. 15m chart shows price fell through support at 4530. And price is finding support around 4518 again. 5m chart shows indecision at 4519, suggesting a reversal. NEED TO WAIT until after the state employment & unemployment report is released.",Y
/NG,11/17/23,8:40 AM,"Current price 2.943. NG is really selling off after some impressive rallies this week! There's an overall gently sloped bearish trend with price falling through a key price level of 3.000. 1hr chart shows price started selling off at 7am today with significant sell offs at 7am & 8am. If price reverses, expect resistance at 3.028 which is the low of the 11/16/2023 @9am candlestick. Price is now back to summer lows, which is significant. Price hasn't been this low since 7/14/2023. 15m chart shows a bounce occuring. Price hit a low of 2.941 and bounced a bit to 2.959. So price is in consolidation, with 2.940s being the low. If there's a bullish reversal, can ride price back up towards 3.000. RSI is oversold at 20",Y
/MCL,11/17/23,8:49 AM,"Current price 74.35. MCL is going back up after selling off to 72.12. There could be a good entry back towards 76 even though news says supply is up & global demand is down. Price bounced yesterday at 1pm and there's been bullish movement since then, which says that price was oversold. The question is what is the new balanced price target? 15m chart shows VWAP is at 73. Significant bullish movement stepped in at 2:45am this morning (what market is that? London?). Price has support at 73.49 (strong rejection from 73.49 back to 73.88. 5m chart shows a reversal occuring after a high of 74.41. ",Y
/MYM,11/17/23,8:59 AM,Same as MES lol,Y
/MES,11/17/23,10:56 AM,"I entered long @4519.25 at 9:01 am on MES early without full confirmation, based on the unemployment rate remaining steady at 3.9%. My plan was for price to go back up to 4530 for about 10 points of profit so I was willing to risk 5 points. I ended up risking only 3 points based on invalidation of my thesis. This was a good trade based on risk management! Price reversed and I stopped out @4516.25 at 9:13 am. It was really good that I was trading on MES and not ES, because of the amount of risk I'm comfortable with relative to my account size while I'm learning",Y
/MES,11/17/23,11:04 AM,This trade I'm marking as red because it was weird. I sort of re-entered MES as a revenge trade @4516.25 at 9:15 AM. Psychologically this trade made sense! I was risking 3 points to make 6 points. Then price went up 4 points and I could have exited at a profit of $20. I didn't and then price reversed and I ended up exiting @4519.75 at 9:22 AM because I didn't feel like losing on a trade where I had a win. This is the part that I need to fix. Would it have been okay to lose another 3 points on a trade where I could have made 4 points? Or was this a low quality trade to begin with?,N 
/NG,11/17/23,11:08 AM,"I suffered emotionally big losses on NG today. I haven't had many NG losses so today was interesting. While I told myself my max risk per trade is $50, it turns out that the leverage on NG is too high to be able to invalidate a trade with only $50 risk. Because of this, I'll make this trade as green because I experienced something new about NG that will help me improve my risk management. NG's 5m ATR today was 0.0120, which is $120 of risk. So any candle that went in the opposite direction of my trade plan would have stopped me out (and it did). I stopped out at $70 on this trade instead of $50 because of this. I went short @2.945 at 9:39 am based on the overall bearish trend of the day, which was good! And yet I was a bit early. And I was actually trying to do $20 of risk. I saw that price had reached a high of 2.947 before selling off so my thesis was that 2.945 was a good entry and that price would hit resistance at 2.947. Price didn't hit resistance at 2.947 and went into the 2.950's where I got worried. Price went as high as 2.955 and I stopped out at 2.952 instead of 2.950. Observe that 952 has significant meaning for me. So it was a $70 loss instead of $50, but 2 cents is hard to time and based on the 5m ATR of 0.0120, it wasn't enough risk to invalidate the trade, even though it was more risk than I was comfortable with. Price had a really nice sell off after I stopped out and I easily could have earned $100. I did feel that whoever I was trading opposite of was trying to trap both sellers at high ends of the range and buyers at low ends of the range by pushing the ranges wider, but it couldn't have just been a coincidence that ranges were being pushed wider instead of what I thought as key price levels holding. So to me this was a good trade because I learned that I need to trade QG instead of NG to have $50 as a reasonable risk amount that will allow properly invalidating trades ",Y
/NG,11/17/23,11:35 AM,"This was actually a bad trade because I decided to go long on such an obviously bearish day, in part as a revenge trade. I could have exited at $10 or breakeven on this trade. God allowed me multiple times and I chose to ignore. Not only that, but even after I could have exited at $10 or breakeven, I hung on until I reached a loss of $90 instead of $50 where it was within my control to stop out at $50. Other than that, this trade was kind of weird, but perhaps not really. I was again trading ranges and the ranges widended, causing me to stop out. I didn't appreciate that price went up to 2.940 right after I stopped out, but I was honestly targeting 2.945 (revenge trade) or higher (a move back towards 3.000). I entered long @2.934 at 9:51 AM believing that price would hold @2.930 based on price making higher highs. So my risk truly was ~$50. I also believed @2.945 was a reasonable exit because price had reached a high of 2.947 and had broken through to 2.955. So this perhaps wasn't such a bad trade from a plan perspective. It's just that NG wasn't range trading like I had thought. The range was widening. What was bad was my risk management. I should have lost only $50 on this. And I didn't stop out at a $50 loss because of 5m ATR and because the first time around, when price went down to a $60/70 loss, price came back up. What I will say is that I'm glad I took this trade. I shot my shot! And I have to keep shooting to become more experienced so that I can win and help others win ",N
Closing Daily Reflection,11/17/23,11:48 AM,"This was a good trading week! I ended the week with a gross profit of $160, a net profit of $122, my account is back positived, *and I maintained a positive net profit for the week in my account*. Of course I would have loved to have ended the week up with a net account balance of $2300 instead of $2019. That said, I didn't end the week at $1800, down another $100 from my $100 loss a few weeks ago. I want to keep practicing in the simulator to improve. Yet I'm happy that I did live trading this week! So I'm trading sideways again, but this time in a systematic way because I told myself today that I had 4 $50 risk shots I could make today, and I made them. I had a small $3.75 win on MES and I lost the other 3 shots. I'm excited to keep going and to keep learning and to keep improving! I now have a sense of how many missed shots I can have and how much I'm willing to risk. If I had said I was only willing to lose at most $100 today, I could have sized down to QG and only lost $17 today. But I have to obtain experience on the bigger leveraged instruments to know what they feel like so I'll be successful when I scale up. Losing $15 on MES doesn't feel the same as losing $150 on ES. Just as earning $237 on ES doesn't feel the same as earning $20 on MES. The same is true of NG. More to learn! It's really cool to see my progress! Also, I'm very excited about The Fin Tea's Trade Planner Reinforcement Machine Learning Model! And I have to add trade volume to the training set data! I would love to enter into the market in December having full confidence of what market conditions and instruments I do well in, what market conditions and isntruments I don't do well in, and where I still need to explore and be okay with risking! Also I started experimenting with alerts and got a successful alert trigger!",Y
